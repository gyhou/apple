rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.5.1,Essential for trip planning,"The RV Trip Wizard is very very helpful planning trips from campground to campground.

The RV Safe Routing ability is also valuable.

Customer service is great - responses to the most basic or highly technical questions are answered rapidly and in a helpful manner.",5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.5.1,Great app! Excellent customer service.,I love that it integrates with RV Trip Wizard. Nice user interface.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.5.0,Great content but keeps crashing,Like the content but keeps crashing on me - only app I have an issue with,2
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.5.0,Love this App,I use this app for every detail of my RV trip planning and travel.  Perfect for for finding the perfect site match and th emaps and GPS systems rock!   I rare need to use another app - period.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.5.0,Go reference,We always check out the sites for our trips.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.4.5,Excellent Campground Finder,"“This app in conjunction with Goggle/Apple maps is all you need to travel and find excellent campgrounds along the way. We travel full time and it is our ‘travel bible’.” 
The preceding was brought to by the App’s AI but I have to agree that it is completely true and it is my go-to app to find campgrounds as we travel full time around this great country called America!",5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.4.5,Could Be Amazing,"I want to love this app but it crashes on a regular basis when reviewing articles. It also can’t handle when you click on a subject within an article, that takes you to a previously published article. It just cycles through, crashes, and takes you back to the original article. I would pay for this app if it actually worked. Instead, I get mad and frustrated cause I can rarely read an entire article without the app crashing entirely. Sad due to the real potential here! Please get this app fixed and working properly because I know there’s others like me willing to pay if you can get this right!",2
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.4.5,Nice integration with rvtripwizard,I love the integration with rvtripwizard as that is what I use to plan my trips. I would pay for premium and use their map software if it supported Apple CarPlay so that a minus one star for me.  Also a Waze integration would be nice,4
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.4.4,Jim,New to the app. Not finding it user friendly yet. May take time.,2
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.4.4,The old rv parks app was so much easier to navigate,The old rv parks app was so much easier to navigate and was free!,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.4.4,Thank you for great information,Very nice work providing information on so many topics. Great work. Thanks.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.4.2,Useless,Don’t waste your time unless you plan to pay a monthly fee.  I had to give it one star to post.,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.4.2,Getting More Annoying,"The information in this app is great and I have used it for a while. Then there came an update that constantly asks to create an account. Also, the map often jerks around on its own after you stop scrolling, especially in an area with a lot of locations. This makes browsing confusing.

Update: Reduced rating based on developer response. Their response was “register and it won’t ask anymore”. Or, you know, don’t keep asking! So basically, deal with it. According to privacy policy, registration requires birthdate and home address, and I will not provide this, especially when the site also indicates they use this for marketing with third parties unless you opt out.

Didn’t respond about map moving abruptly after scrolling, which is especially bad in an area with a lot of parks.",2
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.4.2,"Great product, but...","The thing I really, really need on this app is CarPlay integration. I don’t put my phone on my dash or windshield, so I need a way to see the maps while driving. CarPlay would be an amazing addition.",4
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.4.0,"This may be good, but you need to pay to see the GPS","If you keep the app locked until a subscription is purchased, please add some screen captures to show what the GPS looks like in action.",3
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.3.3,App doesn’t work well,"I’ve tried, I’m about ready to delete.  I rv full time and always looking for resources for safe parks!",2
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.3.3,Annoying pop up about location.,"This used to be my go to app for rv parks, but they add a annoying pop up about your current location, while I’m trying to explore a different location. They should add a current location button, instead of asking me every time I switch screens. If I wanted to explore my current location, I would just type it in. Plus, exploring on rv life people would be most likely exploring elsewhere. I recommend downloading Campendium, until this issue is fixed.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.3.3,Great RV park app,Use this app all the time to find places to stay when traveling. Reviews have been accurate and haven’t led us astray.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.3.3,Has possibilities,"I began using this recently in conjunction with RV Trip Wizard.  My first experience was that the link between the two was broken but it was quickly fixed.  The routing, however, is suspect.  I was routed through a residential and commercial district with lots of traffic, a slow speed limit and ton of lights vs. continuing on a freeway.  Coming back via the freeway saved me 1/2 hour.

Also, I was charged twice to have this app on my phone and iPad.  If that’s correct, I urge you to re-examine your policy. If it’s a mistake, please issue me a refund.",3
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.3.2,Review,Downloaded RV life app to my phone. I get the confirmation screen but no phone confirmation number comes to my email. Unable to get out of that screen or request another confirmation number. Don’t know how what to do. Thanks,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.3.0,"When on map , driving instructions like exit numbers and street names to small to read","While using the GPS in a RV on a iPad the driving instuctins are way to small at the top of the app . You got to be able to read exit numbers, street names etc... Same goes for miles to destination and arrival time.. I am using this on a iPad mini",3
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.2.0,Does nothing,Will not do anything without paid subscription.,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.2.0,Don’t receive confirmation email,Tried several times to obtain a verification email and never receive one. I look in my spam folder to ensure all boxes are checked...MO JOY.,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.1.5,This is not ready for release!!! Avoid!!!!,"To say we are disappointed is an understatement!!  This App does not bring in your RV Trip Wizard route, it makes a new one!  
It took us in a loop around twice for no real reason. 
If you take a call while using it, it forgets where you were before the call and you have to reset the location. 
It does not show you on the turn by turn the exit number or direction, that is only audible!!
On our way to Pipestem WV, it took us down 2 roads that were not even close to be passable by our RV and yes we had the RV info listed correctly. We have to turnaround our 5th Wheel twice into empty fields that really torqued our rig and hitch!!
If you think this is a companion to RV Trip Wizard, it is not and RV Trip Wizard should really second guess offering this link!!
And to think I was going to buy this!! Give it some time and maybe but for now run away from this one!!!",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.1.5,GPS directions bad,"First time using RV Life, it directed us to a road with a 8’10” bridge and our rig is 13’. I had chosen my model and it had the correct height. Luckily there was a “one vehicle road we could get onto to avoid the bridge. Would not trust!",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.1.2,Outstanding ! Essential for campers!,"This is the best, and only app you’ll need to find campgrounds in the US! Much better than any printed directory!",5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.1.2,Crashes constantly,Unable to use for directions since I paid for the service it just crashes every time I try to get directions.,2
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.1.2,Needs some work.,I was very excited to finally find an app to help navigate while driving a large Rv. Other apps I have used have routed me into dangerous situations. So far this app seems to work well. The only issues so far are the ETA is not even close to realistic. This needs to be fixed. Also does not support apple car play.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.1.2,I have requested access many times and never received and email.,Never received access email,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.1.2,Can’t use app without correcting email,"There are two choices I have to try and use the app. Unfortunately, seeing an incorrect email address the only options this app offers are to go to an inbox that doesn’t exist or to resend an email request to a non-existing email address.
Uninstalled due to being unable to correct an email address.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.9,Terrible App!,Terrible app! This replaced Campground Review app and this has to be the most difficult to navigate! Have tried for hours to get even a list of campgrounds near a future location without success. Old app was much easier to use. Found KOA to be much more user friendly despite limiting campgrounds to KOAs. If I need directions I’ll use Google Maps! I need campground listings and reviews not directions!,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.9,Great App for RVers on the move,I have found this App to be a valuable tool for making my decision on where to stay when I’m on the move.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.9,Have enjoyed for years. Excellent RV info source for general rv owners and travel info.,Thanks,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.8,Add,"Rv’ers hidden gems stores or activity hidden in cities.

Rig information: a place where RV’ers can access their rig information in the app.",3
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.8,"Long time web user, better with app",The app makes it much easier to find suitable RV parks than the web version.  Used it for years but now almost never as the app is better.  Browsing the map is very easy and lets me find parks on alternate routes.,4
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.8,Best forum to campers,"This is s great site and my go to place to check campgrounds. Most accurate place for reviews. 
Love it.",5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.8,Fooled again,"Will someone please let me know when a good app for RV’ers comes out? This is overpriced for nothing better than google directions that I already get for free. And the articles are all over the internet! As a new RV’er, I have loads to learn but it certainly wont happen here. When the newb can’t find something to learn, then there’s nothing new here, keep moving along.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.7,Don’t trust it,"I plotted a trip to a campground from my house just to test out what it suggested. You see there is a road that most gps apps will suggest because it is more direct, but it is a very sketchy, seasonal, un-maintained road even for a car. Given my rig size, this app gave the same suggested route that they all do which is on this road. If I didn’t know any better and trusted this “RV” specific gps app, I would have been stuck with no cell reception, or down the side of a cliff. 

They responded that they will update the map servers. Does this mean they are relying on real time human updates? 

I have my family in the truck when I am towing and this app would have literally put us in danger. Since it appears to just be a clone of google maps with worse interface and some poi pre-loaded; I will stick with google maps and hope that they implement a towing feature.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.7,Syncs with RV Trip Wizard,I use RVTripWizard.com as my go-to trip planning tool. I love that the RV Life app syncs with my planned trips.,4
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.7,Very helpful!,"This app has been very helpful so far for our RV trip up and down the east coast! I’d give it 5 stars if I could get the offline maps to work. I’ve downloaded them, but I’m unable to access the maps on my iphone. The app works great though, when we have phone service.",4
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.7,R V Life,"Great app, navigation on and you never get lost. Finding a place is easy with the many resources available on this app. Thank you RV Life, Happy Camping, And real life true reviews. The traveling tips are fantastic, the app teaches you to become a professional Camper! If that’s possible!",5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.5,"Be careful using ""rv friendly"" directions","I have a paid subscription service to RV Trip Wizard, one of this companies online companies. The paid version of this app integrates with RV Trip Wizard. When I first installed and ran this app, it asked for my email address to see if I already had an account on one of their websites and it recognized I was a user of RV Trip Wizard. I entered my RV Trip Wizard password and I was in. However, when I tried to view my RVTW saved trips, it wouldn't work. I sent a customer service request on July 4 of all days, and got a quick response. It turns out I had to log out of the app and back in again. No big deal, but something they should correct in the app.

I had created a trip to an Ohio state park about 3 hours from my house and used the ""rv friendly"" routing option. I tested the route with and without the rv friendly routing to see how the routing would be different. With standard routing, it had me take a country road the final 30 minutes and with the ""rv friendly"" routing, it had me take the Turnpike for most of that final 30 minutes, which made sense. However, it had me get off the turnpike and drive down a narrow but paved country road for about 15 minutes. That was odd, since a few miles further down the Turnpike there was an exit for a state route that would have taken much closer to the campground. That was odd, but the route didn't take me anywhere I couldn't get through so I didn't worry about it too much. Incidentally, RV Trip Wizard online gave me the better route using the state route but this did not carry over into the app integration.

On the way home, it routed me via the state route I mentioned above and that made more sense to me, but I don't know why it was different. However, the BIG deal is on my way home it attempted to route me down a road by my house that is closed from June to October 2019. Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Waze apps all knew to to route around this road closure but RV Life did not. In addition, there was a long backup on I-75 through Findlay due to construction. Again, RV Life did not alert at all or route around it, while Google Maps and Waze both did. 

Given these issues, I don't have enough trust in the GPS routing in the RV Life app to recommend using it. I will try again next Spring and hope the routing has improved. I will continue to use RV Trip Wizard to map the route and then export to Google Maps. That process is a pain, but I trust the routing more. Like any GPS routing, you need to use your common sense and consult a map if something doesn't seem right.",2
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.4,My favorite RV app,As a newbie I was overwhelmed with the apps available and what to use.  This app is the best.  Very easy to use and lots if helpful information.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.4,Will not respond to cancellation requests. Out $22,"There is no information on who or where to contact about cancellation. Support will not respond. App seems ok but no better than what I used before. 
 Frustrating. Will be emailing support every day until they respond. Complete lack of customer support. They owe me $22 for a subscription I tried to cancel through their one and only support portal. If I ask for a refund from Apple they will grant it but then deny the CC used forever. That’s not a solution. 
 Get a true support group that responds. 

DO NOT INSTALL TO TEST UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY ANNUALLY WITH MO WAY TO CANCEL.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.4,Useful App,"I only use the app to locate campgrounds, hence I find the interface a bit annoying. However, it is highly useful for this purpose and I definitely recommend it for the RV travelers out there.",4
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.4,Good app but...,I can’t seem to get the app to sync with my RV Trip Wizard account to load my trips. Is this part live yet?,3
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.4,Most helpful,I just started using this app and so far the information has been accurate. Having reports from actual campers and not the campgrounds themselves makes a difference.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.4,Best App for RV’ers,"Great planning tool!  The best I have found for finding RV parks, reading current reviews, and making reservations.  This app saves a lot of time researching your trips.",5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.3,Like what I see so far,Seems like a great app haven’t used it much yet. Has everything I was looking for will see how the GPS works within the next few weeks.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.2,Greedy scammers,Developer doesn't say up front that some features cost extra which I regard as sleazy. IMHO this company has been buying up and monopolizing good services and apps one by one and ruining them while quietly adding fees that didn't exist before.,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.2,Want this to be 5 stars?,"This is an average app. That’s not a bad thing. Average means it does what I expect it to do. However, you want it to be 5 star awesome- implement CarPlay. I don’t want to fiddle with my phone or buy a car mount when I can simply plug it into my head unit.",3
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.1,Don’t be fooled,This is NOT a free app! You won’t be able to use ANY of the features unless you upgrade to the paid version! Now I have to deal with trying to delete the account I created. Ridiculous!,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.1,Sign in,Can not get email confirmation.    Looked in trash.   Can not recover - locked up,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.1,"Great RV specific app, but...","I am so appreciative of an app that is specifically for RV travelers and their unique requirements and limitations. 

However, there doesn’t appear to be a way to plot a trip that starts somewhere other than my current location; this hinders the ability to plan ahead. 

Also, when I go to the Trips menu, I get a page about downloading a demo of Trip Wizard that doesn’t do anything. The Trip button is no use if Trip Wizard is no longer available, and it keeps taking me back to the Trip Wizard Demo page. 

Since Trip planning is the main point of the app, but the Trip Planner isn’t useful for planning any trip that doesn’t start at my current location, then I can’t give it 5 stars.",3
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,2.0.0,Mill Brook RV Park,"This is our 5th season at Mill Brook RV Park in Kingston  NH.  We love it here and have made some wonderful friends. Everyone is always so helpful and friendly.  We come up from FL. so we can spend time with our Kids and Grandkids.  This is our Northern Paradise and we love it!!

rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.6.2,Outta the rain.......,"Nice RV Park, very clean, nice pond, not far off I-20. Pads are gravel but drain very well, enjoyable stay.",5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.6.2,Great App,I find it very informative when I’m looking for a campground or resort.  It’s a great app for campers to have.,4
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.6.2,Vanlifer Good Tool,"Good app for travel, helpful to plot a course and find things we need that other RV’ers my or may not. I use this in conjunction with other apps and maps. 

We travel in a converted sprinter and don’t need same things big-rig RV’s do (sewer, 50amp, pull-through sites), adversely we prefer some smaller sites that large setups can’t navigate with more privacy and aren’t big gravel lots (woods, fire pits sometimes, etc).

SO, good news is you can read reviews and poke around and see if the site’s for you. I do wish you could filter results by some things that are applicable to ME and other small RV’ers - I’ve said as much in my review to the developers, people camping in smaller rigs is a big movement and there’s nothing this good for that application. BUT, this tool is the best one out, just use it with your brain engaged and you’ll be fine, big or small rig.",4
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.6.2,Very helpful,Excellent!!!,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.6.2,Newbie helpful,I am finding a lot of information that I will follow and keep my eyes and ears tuned to things that one needs to be aware of. I’ll revisit and update after making an extended trip this summer.,4
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.6.2,Issues right off the bat.,Downloaded this app and was sent a confirmation email. Clicked on email and told there were problems and I should contact support.  But no way to do that.  Not exactly pleased.,2
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.6.1,"Great app, connectivity needs work",I was so excited when I found this app. I have used their web based program and share my reviews on trips. I initially struggled to use as the AT&T connectivity was only visible at their website but not in the app. I reached out and they added the AT&T connectivity to the app. I find this tool and the support team exceed my expectations. I have already shared with family and friends!,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.6.0,Excellent product,"I stumbled upon this because I was a fan of the RV Park Review website, which the instant app has incorporated. I’m very impressed with how intuitive this app is. I’m currently using the free version but will consider the premium version down the road. I like that is uses Google maps instead of Apple maps, which is a negative with The popular Allstays app.",5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.5.0,Updated version of an already great app. The best on the market today.,"This new and updated version are worth every cent!

Me and my wife are full timers since four years and this is the first and only app that really work.

Easy to find and compare RV parks and campgrounds with the new map function. You can plan either ahead or when you actually are on the road.

Presented in a VERY informative way where you see where yo are, and what campgrounds are nearby and IN THE DIRECTION YOU ARE TRAVELING!

Other apps shows within a certain amount of miles, but if it is in the wrong direction not much use.

I bought the paid version so I could download the app and use it off line. That is the biggest difference from the free version. And two weeks when traveling on hwy 10 on our way to LA I had use for it since Verizon went down to 2G linger than expected.

Also great when you plan a route and have poor internet.

A new function that I like from last week, is that finally I can use my iPad in landscape mode. For me that was important.

It also tells me that the developer does not just want to cash in short term, but really have the intention to serve us users long-term.

I have seen some fellow RVers complain it is not complete. Nothing is complete and remember - even the sun has spots...

Highly recommended from BasilFawly!",5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.4.0,Reviews missing,Where you read individual reviews for a campground It says “no reviews yet” even though it says there are reviews. This is true for every campground. Something is broken.,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.4.0,My GoTo App for RV Travel,Simply the one App I use for RV Camping,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.3.0,Terrible!!!,Used old site frequently. Since the change I cannot enter site. Unless,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.3.0,Just crashes,"The old RV Park Reviews app wasn’t anything fancy, but it was functional. The new app just crashes while loading.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.3.0,Not as good,Used to use RV Park Reviews a lot to find a campground while traveling. Since they changed to this site cannot filter by Big Rig access without purchasing subscription. Also not near as easy to use to find sites. No happy with change.,3
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.3.0,Almost unusable,You are paying your developer way to much money. We are RVers. You should hire someone who actually has an RV and understands what we are looking for without all the BS.,3
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.3.0,The first thing,Jobless for some of our jobs are going through our first day,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.3.0,Not iPad Landscape Friendly,"I tried to use this in conjunction with my primary RV Trip planner (the web based subscription site by the same company), but the APP does not display in landscape position and is thus, so far, not useable with my iPad keyboard device and my workflow (most of which are landscape position based). As far as the other features of the APP, I never got that far and will not use it, (staying with their web based reviews).",3
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.3.0,"Joke, right?","Tried searching for CG, entered city and state. Search found nothing? Map doesn’t even move to location searched. Delete!",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.3.0,Amazing how much you could mess up a good thing,"I was trying to get info on parks in Florida while I am in the Northeast all it gives me access to is local parks. Well that’s useless, thank goodness for AllStays. Well on the bright side I got more space on my IPad by deleting this app.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.2.0,RV Park Reviews ruined,The old RVPark Reviews was easy to use. We don’t need all the “for you” maps and info. Trying to find parks in a certain area has a learning curve - can only get there at the bottom of the filters pages. I’ll use it but not pleased with the changes.,5
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.2.0,"Was decent, now I can’t use it.","With the last update, the map constantly jumps, zooms and moves. It doesn’t stop. I can’t select and area and stay in one spot when trying to find campgrounds. It’s currently useless.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.2.0,Not for me,"This replaces RV Park Reviews app, except it now is filled with cheap and nasty ads, and couldn’t find the first park I searched for. Don’t waste your time.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.2.0,Time to Find Another RV App,What a sleazy slimy company RV Life is. The free version contains terrible chat ads with skimpy dressed underage girls. Don’t want these ads? You gotta pay up. I guess all your 19 year old male customers are happy though.,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.1.0,Not not impressed,"A) you can only view it on iPad one direction, so if you are charging it’s very awkward
B) your app tracks my location even though my location services are off- this is something other apps allow you to choose- I DO NOT care what campgrounds are near me so CLUTTER CRAP
C) no help or access to tech support so......
This is a sketchy app that as of today am NOT going to buy in app stuff if this part can’t run smoother",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.1.0,Critical reviews are not accepted,"I used to leave reviews on all the major sites including this one. But my reviews here tend to be edited heavily or not accepted at all if they are even slightly critical. They don’t accept reviews if you were unable or unwilling to stay. 

Once they responded to me and said, “the owner denies saying that”. The problem is that I didn’t reference a conversation in my review.  It was a good review! 

My guess is that they are supported by the campgrounds and clear all reviews with them. Could be that is why there are so many campgrounds with no reviews at all.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.1.0,Why try to fix something that wasn’t broke?,RV Park Reviews was great on its own. Should have left it alone.,2
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.0.4,Total crap,This app is useless.  I always used RV Park reviews and was very helpful.  Will delete this garbage and use Good Sam app.  What a mistake!!!,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.0.4,No thanks!,First ad pop up resembled porn. No thanks!,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.0.4,Useless,"Oh boy, did you screw it up! You took RV Park Reviews, to me an indispensable review system to check out parks before reserving. It’s gone. I tried to lookup Pilot Mountain State Park, and it doesn’t even show up. Say goodbye!",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.0.4,Useless After Update,"This took over RV Park Reviews which had its own issues, but was at least OK. They were bad at fixing issues. 
RVLife is much worse. Search function is horrible and mostly does not work at all. Don’t know where some reviews of parks went from the old site. Rating system is a farce. So many parks have high ratings here that are totally undeserving. Nothing like going from bad to worse. After this review I’m just deleting the app, because it’s worthless and I have others I can use.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.0.3,Poor App,Used to be great. No so much anymore.,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.0.3,Incomplete; Not Impressed,"This app took over the RV Park Reviews app. 

I trusted RV Park Reviews and used them often, including contributing my reviews.  But the reviews from that app did not come over to the new app. Therefore, ratings are skewed and information is incomplete. 

If you are going to take something over, then please bring it ALL. Alternatively, provide a way to access that historical data.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.0.3,Deleted,Won’t let me create a userid. Maybe you can fix that sometime.,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.0.3,Would Not Rotate On Ipad,"Uninstalled and deleted. Sorry, will try it again once you have fixed this issue.",1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.0.3,Liked the original web site,Title says it all,1
rv-life-rv-gps-campgrounds,1.0.3,Rotation issue and IPad,Major change to app.  It’s not user friendly due not being able to rotate on the IPad.  The case that my iPad sits in does not rotate. Needs to get fixed.,5

copilot-gps-navigation,10.14.0.134,Failed Test Before Actual Use!!!,"I tried to test this app before purchasing to see if it would be helpful for navigating a trip in our RV.  I couldn’t so I purchased the RV app $29.  I then tested the app by choosing a destination that I knew would be a scary route in any large vehicle.  Sure enough, the route from Sedona AZ (Rancho Sedona RV Park) to Flagstaff AZ gives only 2 options for routes!  One is the switchback and very steep route and the other takes you on an undeveloped dirt road!  Try it and then do a satellite image you will see the switchbacks and the dirt road!  
When I mentioned this to the app developers, they asked me to recreate my issue and save it for them to analyze.  This meant that they didn’t even try to recreate it themselves.  Not proactive at all and I’m not being paid to be their quality assurance tech!",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.14.0.134,Copilot RV review after 1600 mile trip,"I bought this thinking it would be a great app for RV GPS guidance. Well let me list the pros:

Interface is good with traffic display
Customize view 
RV set up 
Speed alerts *  more on this issue with speed alerts
Downloaded maps *. Issues below
Search function is OK. Not bad but you have to enter city zip then enter address or name. Would be easier with just one search entry

Cons. 

Download maps are not upgraded. We ran into many situations that my wife’s WAZE running at the same time saved us. Copilot had missed turns directly to RV spots and I entered the address to the spot.  Missed turns on 2 locations that Waze saved us.  
The lane assist arrows are so small at the top of the iPhone you can’t see them especially in sun light.  The speed alert went off so many times I turned it off. I am in a RV I don’t speed but it went off. Thought it might be me and raised the alert to 10mph over and still would go off at random times. 

Overall I can not trust the app which is why I bought it. We ended up using WAZE since we could not trust Copilot.   Overall a 2 but it has promise just not there yet.",2

copilot-gps-navigation,10.14.0.134,You need to do better,"Update 2020-02-16: 

Please developers fix the systematic bugs. I am very close to having to switch to Apple Maps with some common sense. But I want to use Copilot, because when it works, it is very good.

Latest craziness. In Denver, north on I-25, navigating to east on I-70. It tells me to take the right ramp to Washington street, although it is I-70. Washington is my next exit, off of I-70. Once I’m on Washington it wants me to get back on the freeway for no reason.

In Phoenix, on loop 101 to south on 51. It tells me to stay in the left lanes, with no mention of 51 coming up, until the exit lanes, then it says to exit right. ZERO warning. This also happened on I-10. Speaking of I-10, going eastbound it wanted me to go straight disregarding the truck route.

Original 2 star review:

I have the truck navigation. Multiple times I have had the routing try to make me exit and get back on I-5 in Portland every few miles. Just now in Phoenix it gave me the correct exit and direction, E Cactus off of 51, but once I was on Cactus, it told me to turn around at the next safe location. Why? I was headed in the correct direction. Once in Ohio it had me get off the freeway and onto a city street to go about 10 miles and get back on. By the time I realized it, I was committed. Many other problems. When it works well, it’s great, but I’m losing trust.",1

copilot-gps-navigation,10.14.0.134,Disappointed,"Had read some good reviews but in general have been disappointed with the interface of the app and poor location choices for searches over months we have had the app. St Augustine Florida does not populate as a search choice, for example, (either when trying to plan a route from New England. Any “web” search is just a yelp handcuff. The routing has been good through the tricky parts of CT, NJ and NY pikes, but that is not enough to overcome the inability to give a reasonable destination for initial route planning or when changing a destination on the fly. It would have warranted 4 stars if it were a lower cost subscription or was free. Not likely to renew the subscription.",3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.14.0.134,Latest version,"Used this for years - no problems. After update, the app is very difficult to use. It is very slow. NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEARCH FOR PLACES NEAR A DESTINATION. Three steps backwards from the previous version. I wish I never upgraded.

I also upgraded to to paid version on one iPad. Unlike other apps, it tells me I need the paid version on the second iPad when I want to save a trip. At this point I think -1 star would be generous.c

Now I see RV profile has been removed. Man are they getting greedy. I originally bought this for RV use. I am not giving them any more money. Between two gps's and a map I will find my way.

Update: Now to get RV navigation I have to pay a yearly subscription. I definitely feel ripped off. I originally purchase this for RV. Now I have to pay yearly? Fat chance! I wish I could give this a -5 stars.

It’s very reliable about 90 percent accurate and get the job done. I understand other customers complaints but, nothing isn’t 100 % perfect. What matters is I like it, it’s reliable and it works for me. The key to using this app reliably is mainly how you program it in the settings. The thing I like mostly about this app is; I haul lots of oversized loads across the continental US. Which requires permits and very strict routing. I like the ability to pin drop accurately.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.197,Not bad,Over all its good. Only issues really annoying  is when you pick a route and instead of stick with it gos trying to all the time take you through some kind of highways just to bring you to same interstate 10 miles down the road. Or it keeps wanting for you to take exit just so you can go back right on interstate. Some of the routes its splits for example instead of just keep i95 to go to fl it keeps wanting to take 95 then bunch of different highways just so you can get back to i 95 later traffic alert not that great at all and when they doing construction it tells you that interstate is closed completely and trying to reroute you,3

At first I had some difficulty but it was only my experience which was causing the issues. After a short learning period I was able to plan a route in a matter of minutes.
There are a couple of requests which would be very useful.

 #1   I would like to have a measuring tool.   Sometimes I need to know how far it is to my next waypoint. Or from one waypoint to another.

#2  It would be super handy to be able to share a trip I have saved with another copilot user.  If there are multiple people taking the same route this would ensure all users have the exact same route programmed.

Then finally the phone app. I ran Rand Mc. along side Co-pilot and would laugh at how Rand was trying to route me through cities and town to get to my destination. Co-pilot was way better maybe taking you to the next exit or even using the bypass around major cities. Those days are gone now I guess. 

It doesn’t post the truck speed on split speed limits. 

It doesn’t notify you of scales coming up. 

I can’t find save current location to add to address folder. 

You need internet to find fuel stops. 

And routing has become frustrating. Practical is a joke anymore. 

I’m staying with Co-pilot because the traffic alert is great and I paid the 300+ years ago for the truck app. I will continue to use it as a backup to the Rand. But I can no longer recommend Co-pilot as a truck app especially since they are asking for a monthly fee. 

Should they return to improve this app and start adding useful features for trucks and truck navigation ie: weather and construction warnings scales and truck fuel stops in route like what is on the ALK app. then I would gladly change my rating and review.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Not a happy user,"So i bought the app to help stay away from low bridges since I picked up a new 5th wheeler. First big trip was to West Point NY from Plymouth MA. The app took me through old trucking routes and numerous towns, lots of light etc. to make matters worse, to apps wanted me to take a road that was inaccessible from the highway. I had to use google maps to get me there. 

From there, I drove to Maryland and Virginia and back without a problem until I reached Connecticut. Again, instead of staying on Route 95, it took me through small towns again....

My last trip was to the western part of Massachusetts. The app Was working fine until it took me off the highway onto the main drag, had me circle around through some neighborhood a 5th wheeler shouldn’t be and right back to the exit I took and back on the highway.

Making a rout you want instead of what the computer wants can be a challenge until you learn the idiosyncrasies of the app. For those who complain about it directing them to a closed road or a low bridge I say this is a driving aid, you are the driver, stay alert stay in front of your vehicle.",4

copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Is developer open to user comments for improvements?,"I drive a truck and I am frequently in the northeast where there are many low bridges and truck restriction routes. So I need quality info. So far I find Copilot clumsy. I still run Google Maps simultaneously to ensure I take the right or best route. I got a ticket in NY as approached the Midtown Tunnel after Copilot directed me to miss my exit from the Long Island Expressway to the BQE because it changed my route without asking me or alerting me. This mistake sent me toward the tunnel, which I knew I could not take. I was looking for a way out. Fortunately the cops helped me out of a jam, but gave me a ticket in the process. 

Here are my specific issues. 
Co pilot problems 

1. Changes route without asking me or letting me know 
2. Highway and city names too small to read. Does not get larger when I zoom in. 
3. Has routed me on some routes that are clearly not truck routes and physically impossible for a truck (and yes, my profile has 53’ trailer with 13’6”  height).
4. Algorithms find very convoluted routes that are inefficient, jump off highways and add unnecessary miles and time, and finds routes that go right through traffic with lots of intersections and lights. 
5. Often picks a route in the opposite direction with a u-turn to get back on track. 
6. Does not know how to control the play/pause function when connected to radio/speakers. Often goes silent. 
Causes me to miss turns/exits because of #1 above. 
7. Too many colors and not clearly identified routes, worse in night mode. Look at Google and iMaps. Very clear. 
8. When I try to force it to take a specific route, rather than going direct through the desired route, it goes through the original route, then back-tracks and adds lots of twists. 
I would appreciate info as to what developer is doing to fix these problems, or I have search for another app, especially since I am paying for this Trucker GPS. I really need an effective and efficient trucker GPS, especially in the northeast where getting off route can be very dangerous. If this one doesn’t get fixed, I have to search for another. Paying $10 a month for an app that I have to constantly second guess doesn’t cut it.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Great app and easy to use!,"It’s a very easy to use app, the directions are pretty well right on also, just use a little common sense and it’s a great tool to have in the truck at all times! Highly recommend 🤔",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Unreliable,"I bought this years ago & was annoyed that my purchase didn’t count for anything when it moved to a subscription model. However, I need a reliable GPS on my phone for our RV travels. This isn’t it. On the first trip while using it Copilot directed us down a road that we should never have been on. I don’t blindly follow GPS instructions but neither Apple Maps nor my paper map indicated anything to raise alarms. After we turned into this narrow country road with swamp each side and no shoulders we reached a sign saying that there was no access for vehicles over 1/2 ton or longer than 20 feet. We’re 16 tons and 40 feet and there was no area to turn around. Backing half a mile down a country road to turn back into a busy state highway was great fun. 
Copilot wouldn’t reroute. It kept telling us to turn back onto that road. 
The second time, it routed us onto city streets that had low (very low, one was 9’) overpasses. Luckily, I picked up on that before we turned off. Then the app wouldn’t reroute. 
Third & last time, I ran copilot concurrently with MapQuest, and ran Apple Maps on the iPad alongside. Copilot lost signal and ran around in circles, then tried to turn us around to start the route over. Neither of the others lost our position. Copilot is now uninstalled and I wouldn’t recommend it to any truck or RV driver.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Subscription after purchase,"I bought this app many years ago specifically for the RV features. Now those have been removed and the only way to get them is to get an annual subscription. Sorry, I’m not paying a subscription for something I previously had.",1

copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Review for truck drivers,"This review is intended for professional drivers only. I almost never write reviews on anything, but this app deserves some attention. As you can guess, I have a pretty high opinion of this app, giving it 4 stars, but keep in mind my rating is a comparative one, based on my experience with 3 other “truck” GPS apps.

What I like about it:

The interface is beautifully laid out with large selection buttons, making doing almost anything on the app easy and it’s pleasing to look at and use. 

The navigation for trucks is at least as good as fixed units from Garmin or RM (I have used both and currently use Garmin for primary navigation). There are some bugs, which I will mention later, but it’s still better and more reliable than other apps. 

The included POI’s (truck stops, rest areas, etc.) is good. I can’t rave about this feature for any app or fixed based unit because they are all lacking in my opinion, but this one is on-par with most, at least in terms of quantity. I do have a big POI issue though, which I will mention later. 

Lots of options for customization whether it’s how the map looks, voice prompts, route choices and much more. 

The “Active Traffic” is probably better than Garmin and I would say equal to Google. I also like the way it can display a traffic bar alongside the map, making it very easy to see where the slowdowns are on your route. 

While not as important, this app does something I’ve never seen from any other GPS, fixed unit or app: in most cases it will show you the layout of “roads” within a truck stop or customer lot. And it’s pretty accurate. Can guide you correctly through a truck stop maze right to the fuel island. 

For those that don’t run the posted speed limit, the app allows you to set a “governor” speed to help more accurately estimate drive and arrival times. Coupled with the traffic feature, this can allow for some very accurate ETA’s. That said it would be even better if it would just let you set a “drive” speed, because if you drive faster than the speed limit, it will still only calculate ETA based on the limit (I don’t know many truckers who actually drive 55 while in California... most are doing 58-62). 

When planning a route, it will show you up to 3 different truck-legal options. In addition, after you’ve chosen a route, customizing it is a breeze. This is helpful especially if you just want to alter one little section or a customer has provided specific directions for the “last mile”. This function is easier and better to use than any other GPS I’ve used, including fixed units. 

What I don’t like:

Two big things I don’t like that are largely responsible for my not rating this app 5 stars and even leave me questioning the 4 star rating I did give it. 

First, the cost. For an app that runs on user-purchased hardware (aka smartphone), the price is ridiculously expensive. At $9.99 mo. or $99.99 yr., it can easily add up to as much as or more than a fixed unit over time. I think a one-time purchase price would make sense. Would I be willing to pay $99.99 to have it for life? Probably. It’s good enough to justify that amount once, but not year after year. 

Second, and this may not be as important to some as it is to me, but when searching for upcoming POI’s on-route, it will only look about 30 miles ahead. If you’re like me and start looking for a lunch/fuel/night stop at least a couple of hours out, this app is useless. Because of that, I find myself switching between this app and others, like TP, to figure out what’s up ahead in the next 100-200 miles, then switching back, doing a POI search near a specific city, then adding the POI to my route. I’ve contacted customer support about this and to their credit, and my surprise, they actually responded and did a follow up. Unfortunately, their response was basically “sorry, but that’s just the way it is and there’s nothing we can do about it”. This flaw and their response make no sense to me because if you do a POI search for “nearby”, the resulting list is long and can list places as far as 300 miles away. The problem is you have no way of knowing if any of those places are on your current route or not.

Other, more minor things, I don’t like include not having the ability to set alerts for things that are important, especially for professional drivers, like upcoming weigh stations, sharp curves or steep grades. These should be basic implementations in a truck-based app, especially one at this price point. 

The zoom control on the 3D map is very limited. Want a wide view of your route? Forget it. You can only zoom out about a mile or two. Fortunately, the 2D map doesn’t have the same limitations and even has an auto “zoom to next turn” option. My Garmin does this also AND does it in 3D view. Since I’m primarily using this app as a “backup” to my Garmin, I kind of like the 2D view to give me different perspective. One little bug though is that when I am more than about 20 miles from the next turn, it displays the map in a “north up” orientation even though I have my settings for “heading up”. Once within 20-25 miles, it switches to heading up view. 

Another minor bug I found was that it planned a route exactly as I wanted, but after parking for the night and starting the next morning, it had changed my route. I cancelled the navigation and re-entered the destination, but it still wouldn’t take me on this particular road. So, first it would and then it wouldn’t. Have no idea why. 

I’ve found two stretches of interstate 5, one southbound in California and one northbound in Oregon, that the app showed as closed when they actually weren’t. If you zoomed in to the right spot, you could see where the road was black, marking it as closed. Because of this, it wouldn’t even let me manually alter the route to force it to stay on the interstate. Took me forever to figure out why it was trying to route me off a valid highway and take me an extra 100 miles out of the way.",4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,You pay once for a full app and then,You have to pay again yearly! That’s a no no for me.,1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Too Bad To Describe!!!,"Asked the app to plot a route from Mechanicsburg, PA to East Meadow, NY... The app provided the first turn audibly, and then the audio quit for the rest of the trip!!! We kept monitoring the screen, and it failed to display my need to head to the George Washington Bridge!!! After the app finally recognized that I was on the bridge, and correctly routed me down the Clearview Expwy, however [And this is a HUGE HOWEVER!!!], the app wanted me to continue on the expressway beyond the point where trucks are not permitted!!!!! I am deleting the app, and highly advise against its use!!!!!",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Not for big RVs,I purchased this app specifically because it is supposed to be designed for RV use. First attempt to use it was to go to a campground in N Calif. The app didn’t have the campground in its database although both Google and Apple navigation had the campground on their database.  Second use worked ok it it was to an RV park in a city.  Third time it guided me down a narrow winding dirt road that was barely passable in our 30 foot RV when a perfectly good paved route was available ( same route as Google maps).  This was exactly the sort of situation I had hoped this app would avoid. It appears that it is no improvement over Google maps. Also I find the interface to be not terribly intuitive. Wish someone would come up with an app that is truly designed for RVs,1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Not what it used to be - No support.,"App locked up with my iphone 8plus and my wife’s also twice within one day. Messaged support and the response was reinstall the app and it should be ok. Not so and the rep didn’t even read my post or didn’t understand it. After several responses I gave up. This was a good product at one time, no longer the case. Back to Waze as it much more stable and reliable. Google maps or Apple maps is a better alternative and they are free not $15 per year.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Terrible EXPERIENCE,"I have this app specifically for when we travel with our RV and haul our Toyota Camry behind. This directed us down gravel roads with turns so tight, the front end of my Toyota is a mess from the dolly being jack knifed, causing the front end of my brand new car to hit the back of my RV. This is unacceptable. If I could score this app lower than a 1, I would. I am attempting contact customer support with no success. Not only did I literally put my family’s lives in danger at the dangerous road conditions through a gravel road in the Smoky Mountains, but my brand new car is smashed. I had my car type and length in the app, but that did not matter. I can not explain how terrible this trip was. I would NOT recommend this app and in fact will now have to pay quite a lot to fix my car. Ridiculous.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,They stole money from me.,"I bought this app a few years ago and it came with RV navigation.....the main reason I bought it. Since that time, they have done many updates and have conveniently removed the very feature I BOUGHT AND PAID for.
Now, if I desire to access the feature I originally BOUGHT AND PAID for, I have to pay them a yearly subscription fee.
To me, That is outright FRAUD and stealing.
So, now I must move on to another app that isn’t so underhanded and dishonest.
Update: Customer Service refuses to even acknowledge my issue. They are sending me many emails to pay a subscription for a product I already paid for.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Horrible,"First time use of the app on our last trip. Three separate times it routed us off the main road we were driving on, had us go a mile or two, make a U turn and go back to the same exit we just got off and told us to get back on. Not fun in unfamiliar areas pulling a 38’ camper. We just ended up using Waze instead. Way better. Hope I can get a refund.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Needs some work,"I like the idea of Putting in the height of your vehicle. I drive Limousine’s for a living and I am in multiple vehicles every day. But the app is not that user-friendly or I am just new to it. I’m debating whether to pay $29 a year for the RV GPS. Strictly for the fact of height requirements of bridges. This is not an option with other mapping apps even the big guys, nothing worse when you’re driving a motorcoach and it routes you down a street where the bridge is too small or low and you have to turn around or something else happens that is not so favorable.",3

copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.80,Disappointing,"I’m so disappointed in this app. I was looking for a good app for routing while driving an RV to make sure the roads were passable. This app was expensive for the RV subscription and quite honestly I will probably delete it in favor of Waze or just back to google. It beeps loudly and incessantly for often no reason. It often showed me off road when I was clearly on the road. When I needed it most at an intersection where I could choose several paths it froze completely and came back too late with the path I had chosen against and wanted me to back track to get there. It refused to show me the original path I had planned on. At that point I gave up and pulled out waze. I still can’t believe I wasted $30 on an app I don’t trust and probably won’t use again. Oh and beyond all that, the interface is incredibly non intuitive and hard to program a trip to begin with. Total waste of money.",2

The copilot logo comes up, and that’s all. It doesn’t make it to the navigation screen most of the time. When it works I have to keep the app open in order to use it. If I accidentally close it and try to reopen it right away, I’m out of luck. Like any other app, if I leave it open in the background and go any length of time without using it actively, it reloads itself. Unlike every other app I use, it doesn’t actually reload when it does this. Please fix this.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.35,High hopes but poor routing,"I had high hopes for this app since it replaced one of the most popular RV compatible apps on the market. 

But then it tried to route me through a tiny narrow street in downtown Livermore CA that made no sense to select versus sticking to the truck route round the old downtown, as a way to pass through town.  Luckily my wife noticed we were headed towards a cluster and busted out Google Maps which got us through town in one piece.

Once not driving I checked out the routes chosen by copilot and by sygic using the same vehicle parameters....6 tons, 50 length, 8ft wide, 13’ tall....for my trailer plus truck. 

Sure enough, copilot kept sending me through downtown Livermore along first street.  Sygic bypassed downtown on roads that were more appropriate for a rig just passing through.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.35,Questionable Suggestions,"Living in the mountains of WV and pulling a rig totaling 55 plus feet leave me wanting to stay straight roads as much as possible. This app often suggests routes that are narrow and very curvy. Selecting a two lane road verse a four lane to save a few minutes seems to me like bad logic. I'm not even confident that the selected route considers my rig dimensions,when making some of these suggested routes. Being a new user, I may grow more confident but based on my limited use It is not worth the cost.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.35,It only has to misrouted you 1 time in a 43’ RV to lose trust in it,"This app gives you the ability to enter the dimensions of your rig and I would assume it would use that information to give you relevant features. For example, search for truck stops along my route. Nope!  I can search for gas stations, but that doesn’t include truck stops. If I need a truck stop, I have to search for it by name. So, I use multiple apps (RVParky is awesome) to find truck stops and then search for it by name in Copilot. 

Another issue with this app is there is no way to update a map and save changes, instead you have to remember the name of the file (including capitalization) and save over the file.  Not a deal breaker, but a sign of rookie developers. This is a simple change and should have been done from the beginning. 

There are a lot of features in this app that you better get familiar with before you learn the hard way. For example, I included a highway service area as a stop and the service area divides the cars from the trucks. The program told me to stay right (cars) but I stayed left since I’m in a large RV. Apparently the lanes were just far enough apart that the app routed me 45 minutes out of the way and took me right back to the same service area. I will edit my trip from now on by deleting stops as I come to them. This delay cost me a night at a campground while we slept at another service area for the night. So, this app has already cost me more money than just purchasing it.

I would think long and hard about choosing this over a Rand McNally GPS!  I wish I had spent the money on a device instead of this app. But, I’m still using it and holding out hope that the developers make the necessary improvements. If they don’t, I’ll be forced to buy the proper equipment.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.35,The Best,"Way better than specific built truck gps’s sold at truck stops. Gets you into and out of cities, towns, etc on the truck route. Will not route on roads that are not legal for a truck, will not route you under bridges that aren’t high enough for your rig. Full customization available for hazmat, over height, over weight etc. best of all, it’s on the phone,(or tablet), you already have! If you update your device, just re download it to your new device for free. If you have bad or absolutely no cell coverage... doesn’t matter, this works off of the gps system so it’ll work anyway. Just like anything else, it isn’t perfect, I’ve found obscure, and/or new roads that wasn’t noted in the system, (and they have a way to submit that so it’ll be included in their next update), but 95 to 99 percent of the time, this gps will get you where you are going... legally. To many features to go through, but all are useful and rival what I used when I had a dedicated gps back in the day. SO GET IT ALREADY!!!",5

copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.35,From a very good Android app to slightly diminished capability apple app to SERIOUSLY,"The only description I can give having used both fully paid and featured android app for both cars and enterprise which rightly held top spots to a placeholder app. My honest opinion is this has become for whatever reason a rock bottom effort to develop, create appearance of legitimacy by bare minimum cloud usage due to being necessary for obvious features, and seem to be in active development probably just to squeeze any last dollars before fading away. I used to switch from Copilot Android to the $99 Navigon (which also went bye bye) as they seemed to have dueling features with each update. Honestly this app has somehow reduced down to a GUI somewhere between a joke and cheap with paid add-ons that are either just unnecessary or free with every other decent free gps app. I can’t fault the dev because I certainly understand how any business with cash flow problems, rapid evolving competition, etc who initially invested real effort could want to make any last cent but boy this is a frustrating to use shadow of itself that should sell whatever technology rights they still can market and take a bath. Or bring back something resembling the original Copilot.",1

Trip planning is very nice. There is a learning curve, but its not insurmountable. Also, the app sometimes did strange things when trying to change a route by dragging the calculated route.

When we bought CoPilot originally, it had several very nice features but when it was first sold off, the new owners (ALK?) unbundled many of the good features and we lost stuff we had already paid for. (Must have been taking lessons from the airlines.😆)  Now that Trimble has taken over, our favorite features have returned and it looks like this is going to be a good iteration, as long as they don't get greedy.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.10,Updated; Getting better,"Update: after contacting the developers I found that I did not lose my previous purchase as it appeared. I have checked several routes I travel both with my camper and without. CoPilot has performed better than using google maps! Google maps assumes I am in a car, CoPilot routes me on better roads for RV travel. In fact, comparing my known routes (google v. CoPilot), CoPilot was the only one who gave me reasonable travel directions. Google gave several back roads I know I can’t travel. 

The app it’s self is ok and getting better. 
I am very disappointed that I paid full price, over $60 last year for this app, and now it is being marketed as a free app with subscriptions. The subscriptions are significantly less expensive then when I purchased the app. I purchased the app for an RV and paid for one year of Active Traffic.... now this is less than half the price. 

ALK Tech really owes its customers something for purchasing at the original price. If nothing else they should give a second year of the service to the account. 
Also the customer service is very lacking. No where can I find a contact for the CoPilot service to ask these questions... only for the parent company that likely won’t lead anywhere.",4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.10,This thing almost killed us!!!,"If I could give it negative rating I would .  This guided us into a closed road with our 45 ft motor home and 25 ft trailer.   A very narrow rd.  There was also a rr track paralleling the rd and a few trains came along while we were trying to figure out what to do. Tried to back up into a rd that was crossing the track but it was uphill and we were blocking traffic as well as it would have left the trailer on the tracks if a train came along as there wasn’t a long distance and was onto the tracks as well.  There was a narrow driveway with a ditch on both sides ahead and only because my husband has experience with tractors with trailers was he able to back in and get us out of there.  If he had not been as experienced as he was we would have had to pay for a tow out of there, they would have had to unhook the trailer with the car and tow the motor home backwards then we would have had to have the trailer turned around and towed it back to the motor home to be hooked back up.  After we did get ourselves out of there the app kept trying to reroute us back at which time we turned it off and guessed our way out of the town and back to the interstate.  This took place because we relied on it to go from the campground we were at to the interstate.  I am on a trial for this app and nowhere can I find out how to opt out so before you start your trial period find out how to get out of it first.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.10,Useless app,You can’t do anything without upgrading. So what’s the point? Google maps does more and it’s a free app. I wanted to try this app while towing my 45’ 5th wheel RV in hopes it would prevent us from driving in small areas or getting trapped in tight gas stations etc... but why would I pay almost $30 for the RV driver app if I have no clue th his app would even help?!? Don’t waste your time unless you just have money to throw away if it doesn’t work.,1

The other option needed is for the trucker portion, add an option to prioritize interstates, I’m sick of trying all these shortcuts through town because the gps thinks it’s shorter.. it ends up taking more time!",3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.10,Great App,"The big advantage of CoPilot is that it is always working. Too often I find that I lose the audio on my Apple Maps, or I’ve lost my data connection using Google maps. CoPilot has maps built-in, so they’re always ready to go. My only complaint is that sometimes they’re not as accurate as Google, but that’s a problem for Apple Maps as well.",4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.10,RV Profile removed,"I’ve liked and used this app for 5or6 years on both Android & Apple platforms. As a customer that already paid for a product with RV support - (3 times...between both platforms and my wife’s android tablet) - I feel that is it very deceptive to remove features so you can start charging a subscription.

Old customers should be grandfathered in and the new model should only apply to new customers.

Otherwise it’s a big “screw you” to the customers that helped get you here.

I won’t be subscribing. It’s unfortunate because it has been a favorite app for me for a long time.

I’m a capitalist and I have no problem with copilot finding alternate revenue streams. 

But removing a feature just so you can sell it back to the customer is the worst way to increase revenue. 

This kind of business practice makes it impossible to recommend to people.

If they did it to RV feature they can do it to every feature.

It’s a shame.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.10,Support for product line Leaves much to be desired.,"I purchased Copilot RV in 2018. It proved initially useful, but halfway through my trip, my App was replaced without notice by CoPilot GPS.  The latter is an inferior product. The company stopped support for the former version that rhey discounted, knowing full well that they would no longer support it. Great business ethics on the part of CoPilot.

I replaced Copilots RV/GPS  with a standalone GPS from Garmin.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.11.1.10,Features I purchased have been switched to premium.,"I bought this app several years ago and it worked fine. I didn’t need or want voice navigation.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,Best truck navigation,"If you previously had the purchased version of Copilot Truck, this version will still work the same without the monthly or yearly subscription fee. From what I can see, it still gives you the option to purchase the annual Active Traffic service also. It would be nice if ALK would put that as a note in the description. I held up on the update thinking I would be going to and annual fee and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Otherwise it's the same Copilot Truck I've been using for years and it's still the best.",5

copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,Two Deal Brakers,"Started my trial today.  Three observations that I have made so far.  Two are a deal breaker.  First the voice is computer generated and not natural voice so it gets on everyone’s nerves so bad we can hardly use it.   Also I need a trailer towing section to add dimensions and weight of my towing.  Other than that, I will continue the trial and update this if I find anything else.  The non deal breaker was that I didn’t get to pick an icon to place on the road during navigation.",3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,"A good app, but terrible support!","I’ve been using the app for about a year and it has never issued a bad instruction. It’s multiple route to choose from and the traffic features are a real winners.

The problem comes when you try to reach someone at the developer for tech support. They are slow to respond, don’t answer your question and leave you high and dry.

My subscription is still with in the one year I paid for, but the app is back to basic mode and asking me to pay again. A simply fix for them, your thinks, but no. It’s been 3 days and now the weekend is here and I have no option but to repurchase something for which I’ve already paid. 

I rely on this app to assist me in safely and reliably doing my job and have communicated that to them, but have been ignored. So buy this app with the knowledge that you may be on your own.",1

copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,App still has a long ways to go,"App still has a long ways to go

Downloaded the RV app as we need an app that will help keep us out of trouble while on the road. I have a 2016 Chevy LTZ 2500 that we pull a 5th wheel with. 
Downloaded the app and set it up, and first time out, and very disappointed. If you have your phone plugged in the USB port on your vehicle, to charge your phone, or so as I do use it so I can talk into truck speakers and mic pickup, play podcasts, use wifi and everyday operations in the truck, the speed display on the App will be about exactly 1/2 of actual speed. So time to the destination is wrong, turn time and distance is wrong.more seriously the warnings one would expect to get, traffic issues etc will NOT function properly.

I asked for a refund and discuss this issue with a person and was sent a new link to a new support ticket that takes you to a site only to reregister. 

If you plan on charging your phone, talk on it, use your phone while plugged in to your vehicles then don’t buy it. It could be serious dangerous. Too bad CoPilot! And you should disclose the issue

Here’s there answer: The conflict of speed limit displaying in CoPilot can be caused by the cable USB connection to the truck. You need to unplug the cable in order to have CoPilot displaying the correct speed.

Unfortunately, the issue you are experiencing is linked to the cable connector not compatible with CoPilot which we do not support.

If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to let us know.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,Low bridges/ speed limit/ location of addresses,"I have wanted an app like this for a long time. My job requires me to drive around at 14’8”. I gave this app a try, and I will not be purchasing the full version. However, if they would like my input I would continue to work with the developers for free.

1. I almost hit around 6 or 7 low bridges throughout the iron range of upper Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The app did not have them marked. Thank god the state did, clearly a 14’2” bridge. Which litters all of us hwy 2 and us hwy 41. I would be as bold to say that most the bridges in the UP are 14’6” or lower at least. I was so busy I didn’t get a chance to flag them all. They should look into it. 

2. The locations of where I was going were off by at least ten miles. I had to use google maps to get there.

3. Speed limits are off. It beeped at me for 30 miles of 55mph. The app has it as a 45mph. This was before I learned about the accucheck however so I didn’t get a chance to flag it.

The one good thing is: so far I believe it’s truck routes to be accurate at least. I was never on a weight restricted road. 

After all is said is done, I would be open to helping the developers improve the app for free, but at this point there is no way I would pay money for an app that is basically a less accurate version of google maps. 

Please improve low bridge feature for sure. Anything under 16’.",1

Now, just went to upgrade, so I could use the search feature. Only upgrade includes online access. The best feature of copilot was being able to navigate off-line.

Absolutely just crushed, what was completely free and such a breeze and made routing my days so simple and amazing...overnight they flip it completely and now I can no longer use this. Such a shame. This was one of my favorite and most used apps for work. You messed up CoPilot, you messed up.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,So far severely flawed - positive update,"Update 12/22/2108

Customer support was really helpful and the situation of not finding my home address has been resolved by downloading another correct map.

Looks good now, I just need to get back to the States end of January to take it on a test ride.
________________________

Trying to get started with the new app I couldn’t even enter my home address. It would not find it (it is simple and found by any other app).

It doesn’t even find my hometown Charlotte, NC - a 1.5 million metro and the biggest city in North Carolina. What’s up with that?

Also positioning the cursor by pressing down on the keyboard on my iPhone 7 does not work.

The app still needs quite some improvement.",4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,"Latest update breaks RV functions, deletes paid features","This company has lost my trust. I was happy to pay for a premium subscription to this app which was admittedly cheaper than it could’ve been, but on the latest update they deleted critical features, apparently moving them to a MUCH more expensive optional subscription. And I found out the hard way when the app tried to take me under a low underpass that the prior version would’ve avoided. 

I’m very upset that my prior purchase is rendered worthless. If they did that once before, why should I trust them again? Beware that if you pay for an annual subscription this company, you may not get what you pay for.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,Latest Update Screwed Loyal Users..,"I’ve used CoPilot GPS for years and had my routing profiles set up and ActiveTraffic subscription set.  I’ve submitted a number of map updates along the way.  The latest update deleted my custom routing profiles and now I can’t recreate them because the RV option was removed and forced into a subscription, apparently. 

As soon as my ActiveTraffic is up, I’m done with CoPilot. The only thing holding me right now is everything is still in tact on my Android device. 

Pity, it was such a good product.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,Carplay support,Great app but really needs Carplay support.  I find that I am using other map programs more due to the integration.,4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,"Longtime Copilot user - mostly good, but a few deficiencies","Originally bought Copilot 10 years ago for my iPhone 3G.  Regular updates of have been decent, but I have 4 complaints (minus 1/2 star for each)

1) The voice doesn’t speak everything you would like to know which is super annoying and forces your to look at the screen, which is fine if you are a passenger, but not so if you are driving.   Instead of saying, “In two miles, exit right on 247 B” like it should, it will only say “In two miles, exit right.”

2) While having an active destination being routed, you cannot zoom out, and have bird’s eye view of your route.  I tried in both 2D and 3D views and neither would function. 

3) No Apple Watch integration... would love to be tapped on my wrist when my turn approaches

4) no CarPlay integration",3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,My go to travel app,"BEWARE: The latest update  has removed the RV Profile.  I am not sure if they have put it in a premium addition but I can no longer find it in the update or as an in-app purchase.  I’ve been using Copilot for several years and it has always been my goto app especially when I get lost.  That being said, use with extreme care, as you should with all navigation devices.  For the majority off the time Copilot has been very good throughout Canada and the US as I travel very extensively. However, I once let my guard down and nearly ran out of gas a long way from any town.  The discovery was made when it routed me to a graveled forest service road.  It was 60 miles to get back on track and to the nearest gas station.  Check other resources and question the choices made by Copilot.  It makes mistakes too and when it can be a life or death situation use extra caution when vectored through less traveled routes.  Still, it has been a valuable app and has helped me many times, especially being in the proper lane for an exit.  I still recommend it and with the voice directions.  I do not recommend the Apple TTS voice as that will drive you insane with annoyance as it reads every little detail.  I go with Lisa.  I removed a star because the dropped the RV profile.  Also the information for this app is incorrect as it still includes RV specs not found in the app.  This is misleading.  I tested the update on an older device and will not be upgrading on my new devices because I use the RV profile for highway speed and preferences.  Don’t trust height or propane as the premium RV customers warn in their reviews.",3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,No more RV support in northeast,What the heck happened?  An update is supposed to be better not worse. I paid for this app because it helped with towing RV. Now it’s useless because “it’s not supported” anymore.,1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,You removed the RV Profile in version 10.10.0.535,"I have been using this app for several years and the latest version has now rendered it useless.  I assume it is to force those of us using the app for RV navigation to buy the more expensive version.  I will be shopping for a navigation app, but will be looking at competitors since ALK Technologies has cast me and a number of others adrift.  This is quite the topic on the RV forums and many are as upset as I am.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,Long time user,I’ve been using CoPilot since 1998. Awesome program.  Looking forward to seeing a CarPlay version.  Cellphone coverage isn’t that great in my area and to have offline maps would be a huge blessing.,5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.10.0.535,Lost RV Support,"This most recent update deleted all my RV settings and no longer show an RV as a vehicle option. WTH? I’ve been using and recommending this app for over 8 years and you just killed it. After spending money on the premium version, I now am expected to purchase an RV version for another $40. Way to treat current customers. You should at least offer an upgrade at a discount for current users.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Bad App,Seems to be missing places that I can find on MyDrive by TomTom.  Missing major roads headed to my work from my house.,1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,I paid for this and I regret it,"Apple support did not help me to get my money back. Don't download this app it is an ugly app with lot of problems. Download ""here we go"" is free and has a lot lot more functions. I am dissappointed with Apple also. This was my first and last Apple product I ever buy. (Iphone xs max)",1

copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Terrible now 10/2018,"We have used this App for at least five years, possibly more, and could always depend on it.  We just completed a 14,000 mile trip back and forth across the US.  Initially we noticed more problems with routing, even being directed under a 10’ bridge with our 13’ RV.  That was something that had never happened before, and we had always trusted the App.  The road mapping just didn’t seem to be working as well, and we were happy to see a required update with new maps come out.  As instructed by ALK Tech we updated the app, removed the old maps and installed new.  WE CAN NO LONGER TRUST THIS APP.  We were incorrectly directed onto bridges that do not allow vehicles over 24’ in length, that were too low, onto roads that don’t allow vehicles of our size, onto off ramps on freeways, only to be directed right back on to the same freeway, and to incorrect locations.  Everything we could trust before, cannot be trusted any longer.  Our account seems to have been downgraded to a Demo account, although we actually had a Premium account before the upgrade, and I cannot get any help from the tech team.  DO NOT INVEST IN THIS APP - until you start seeing better reviews come through.  It is inconvenient at best, with all the mistakes in routing, and very dangerous at the worst with the risk you run of being put into a bad situation with a long, tall RV.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Great For Offline GPS car navigation,I was reviewing gps apps and this one so far seems the best. It is fast and reliable in its navigation.  I would much rather use offline gps apps like copilot since they do not rely on cell signal which are not available everywhere and why use cell data if u dont need to.  The traffic feature does use cell data but only a little and u can turn that off if u want when going overseas etc. i like also that u can download certain areas of the usa or europe maps which saves space.,5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Not user friendly,Works great on a windows phone but not very user friendly on an iPhone,4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Like it overall but some issues - updated update 2 dangerous app.,"Finally used this for a few thousand mile trip and can definitely state that it is dangerous. Had the profile set to RV and 13 foot high. It guided me off the main route to my destination, then navigated to a narrow lane through the woods to get back to the main road. I managed to avoid this disaster by making a K-turn and going back to the main road, then drove past the “road” it had wanted me to take. It didn’t exist. Somewhere between where it wanted me to turn and the intersection with the main road, it dead ended. Had I taken it I would have had to try to back my 35 foot trailer nearly a mile, assuming I didn’t get stuck in a muddy rut. DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!

Pros - can add RV height to the vehicle to avoid low bridges (really a great help); can create and store trips for future use; maps can be loaded in sections to conserve space - maps are used offline.
Update - in traveling with our RV, we like to avoid interstate highways. Most gps apps and devices have an option to avoid highways. If selected, you end up with ridiculous routes sometimes hundreds of miles out of the way. This app provides a selection of options where you can select how strongly you want to avoid highways. Then it routes on interstates only where it makes sense. Good feature that should be in all navigation devices/apps,

Neutral - provides lane guidance that has become standard; options for routing includes standard avoidances including dirt roads.
Update - the lane guidance is definitely behind the state of the art and desperately needs updated. 
While the map information does not need any internet, traffic conditions (available via paid subscription) does require internet.

Cons - no way to get speech working with Chrysler Uconnect if also using hands free phone; graphics for lane guidance pretty poor; speed limit info seems very limited; traffic info requires yearly subscription;
Update:
Speed  limit display :unlike every other nav device and app, speed limits are only available for interstates, rendering it mostly useless.
Routing: Seems to route through the middle of towns and ignores bypasses when not on an interstate. Very irritating with an RV. 
POIs: basically totally useless. Most are flat wrong. Indicating gas or food where there are only fields.
Text to speech on Apple- this is terrible. There is one voice that cannot be heard over normal road noise that does text to speech. Other voices have great volume but are irritatingly generic with statements like - exit in 2 miles. You have to look at the screen to see what the exit is called.

Update overall: not clear that the serious problems out weigh the advantages. Still searching for a really good navigation app but this definitely isn’t it.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Speed limit alert not showing,"The speed limit alert does not show, even after I set it up in settings.  If this worked, it would be good.
Reported this a couple times already, but still not fixed.  2 Nov 2018.",4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Good mapping but search if not good,The big problem I have found for an RVer is no searching from state and national parks. The way around is to search address in another app then make it a contact then I can map it. It would also be nice to be able to put a stop in the trip.,4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,This app is awful!! DO NOT BUY THE NEW VERSION!!,"I originally bought CoPilot a few years ago to use while driving through Italy. It was a dream -it enabled me to falling back roads, drive without using cellular data and gave crisp voice directions which guided me through town by town.

Unfortunately, this new version is unusable. When I bought the new version for Spain and Portugal I found that the cost was $25, because I could not purchase a single country map. The new version is inaccurate (the red dot indicating where you are is constantly humongous around and almost caused a number of accidents as I swerved to take an exit at the last second). It does not contain Voice (unless you pay an additional $18) and is impossible to figure out. I am usually very good with technical matters, but this one continually eludes me. Simply said, I hate it! The old version was terrific and this one is worse than asking a two-year-old child for directions.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,It’s Often Incorrect,"This gps often shows incorrect street signs, or exit names. I often missed my exit off the expressway because the gps showed something different than what I was looking at in real life. It was very frustrating. It’s just not as accurate and up to date as more popular gps’s. I also didnt like that there wasn’t an option to pause your music or podcast while the turn-by-turn voice spoke. Other gps will do that and this one wont. I also found that it will sometimes randomly redirect you even if you were on the path it told you to be on. It’s just not a great app. I wanted something different than apple maps, but this app is only different in negative ways.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,A great Navigation app try it!,This is a great innovative flexible and easy to use navi app you don’t need to use your data connection but recommends to turn better accuracy which helps it coordinate but it’s not always accurate with directions but a lot of navi apps have them issues as well. One problem I noticed is when you want to search for a business or like a location it may not show up in search. But seems to be getting even better over the years. So for the price of $10 for voice turn instructions and the functionality and reliably I would recommend this app as current version!,4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Great App,"Anytime I need direction , cell service or not it never lets me down.",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Great Job,"The team should be congratulated for their effort. This is a great app. Two things come to mind that make me a fan. The Maps are resident on your phone, so if you travel to an area (like mountains) with no cell service you don’t have anxiety about if you phone will have all the data it needs to properly navigate. The other is the traffic bar, you can “see” out 100 miles and know what’s coming.",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Fantastic easy to use app!,"I’ve found this app to be very easy to use, intuitive and clearly designed to fit the users needs!",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,RV Driving,"The majority of the time this app works really well. There have been a few times where it’ll say take a left, but when you look at the screen it has you taking a right. When this happened the screen was correct.  Not the verbal directions.
There is a one-way street in my neighborhood, and the app always has me going down the one-way street in the wrong direction.",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Good and Bad,"This app is so much more flexible than the other gps apps I’ve used!  I love that I can control the look of the app, set my preferences, easily change routes,etc. HOWEVER, I don’t like that the routing instructions are frequently wrong and sometimes even dangerous!  Yesterday in Philadelphia, it told me to take several turns that were the wrong way on one way streets. Then it tried to get me to drive past my exit, go a mile, make a u-turn and go back to my exit!  When I ignored it and just took my exit, it kept trying to route me back until I got 10 miles up the road - then it gave up. I am using the latest version of the app and the latest update of the maps.  In summary, love the app most of the time but very frustrated with some of the routing instructions.",3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Version 10.7,"I upgraded to this version on 7 October 2018

Since then I have had a number of issues with the program and basically it is not functioning for me .

copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,INFORMATION DID NOT TRANSFER,I lost every piece of information and addresses from years of using this. I should not have had to reinstall all of the information back into the app. I don’t appreciate it.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Voice???,"I am a original user of CoPilot, love the app, it was excellent in Europe as well, especially appraising of traffic camera traps.  Anyhow I had CoPilot HD, was wondering why iPhone X support was lacking for a year now.  I was just notified to move to this current CoPilot GPS which now supports the X phone, yeah!  Two issues, one was exporting all contacts from the old HD app to CoPilot cloud then importing them into this new app, it didn't import them.  Second issue is the voice, it should use Apple TTS but the voice is not Siri like, it's a low toned male-ish terrible robot voice, yuk!  What's with that?!?  Will the downloaded Copilot voices do full TTS?  I don't think so.",4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,"App is fine, dev support is another story","App works fine but developer is slow to update software. Can go over a year without any updates. They never updated the software to correct app scaling on a iPhone X display, they finally fixed it after iOS12 release. iOS12 was announced in June and now has support for third party Nav apps in CarPlay. Developer didn’t make a statement until sept 27th that they are now “looking” into it while other companies already have CarPlay compatible apps out, like google maps, or going through Apple Review right now, like Sygic. Developer is lagging behind other solutions.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.7.1.178,Not happy,"I have been using CoPilot now for over three years, possibly one of the best GPS phone based navigation apps I have ever used. The new update has made me second-guess the app, the new voice sounds like a speak and spell.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,How Times Have Changed,"CoPilot used to be my default nav app. Due to nothing but headaches with activations on new phones, I moved to Apple Maps. 

While Apple Maps keeps improving, CoPilot seems to have gotten worst. I'm trying to get ready for a multi stop 2 week trip through Italy. I've been at it for 4 hours now and have managed to enter a grand total of 3 addresses. On one occasion it could not locate the street but had the hotel as a poi. BUT, it can't navigate to a POI. 

I haven't paid anything for the app. Seems first map comes free. But, it's either crippled intentionally (they could say so). Or the app is very weak. Again, 4 hours to enter 3 addresses so far. I'm not paying for this without any idea of what I get. Especially since I already paid for all of Europe but can't get it activated. It used to access Contacts but that option no longer appears in the menu list. Manually is a horrible experience.  

Going back to Apple Maps. Will buy a data package at the airport.",2

Review Update!!!! 
  A big thanks to the CoPilot team for actually responding to my ‘review’!! I am looking forward to their next update in the hopes that my one ‘big’ issue can be resolved!!! Should this happen...I will give the best updated review in BiG Bold Letters!!! 👌🏻",3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Not for RV even though it has RV profile,"I was told this app can be used for RV’s and has an RV profile where you tell it the size of your RV. You can also tell it what type of roads to avoid. I set up my RV profile, told the app to avoid local roads if possible, and use freeways and divided highways as much as possible. Luckily we kind of knew the area, because the app tried to take us through the middle of Brooksville (a small town in FL)on 98 instead of the 98 truck route around Brooksville. Had we followed the app we would not have cleared a train overpass in the middle of town. I have also read the reviews for Co-Pilot RV and they have the same issues. Unfortunately I paid for the in app purchases before I knew how bad it was.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Great but not perfect,"So the only hiccup I have had is while in Ireland, we exited a roundabout, instead of having ugh to the next roundabout too soon. and turn around, it sent us on a 10-20 minute detour and eventually telling me to turn around. Other than that one instance it has helped me travel all across the island without having to use data.",4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,"Great for up close, bad for planning routes on the fly","The great advantage to CoPilot is being able to download maps to your device so you don’t have to have cellular data as you wander. I like this feature. However, the program itself has issues, depending on how you use it. I chase storms and used it on my iPad this season in conjunction with a Bluetooth GPS device. I like to use the program in 2D map mode for situational awareness. I like that the map can be locked in the “north up” position. But while it’s great for up-close views of the next farm road or the next few turns, when one zooms out even a little to plan a route, even major roads (U.S. routes and interstates) completely vanish, and others appear as segments if they appear at all. I understand secondary roads vanishing when zooming out, but major ones? The company says this is a “feature” that is not a priority at this time. I find it essential and am not sure the app was worth $14.99 for the limited functionality.",3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Direction,"This app is great, there are a few things that needs to be improved. 1 is it will have you making illegal turns on one way streets . 2 of there is construction going on the app doesn’t pick it up and reroute you, even if you ride pass it the assigned route it will keep trying to reroute you back to the original route that was closed.",3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Updates,The map needs update.,3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Great route adjustment - rerouting,"I have several nav/gps apps.  This one is well-designed to use/see while you're driving. It has viewing modes.  It's very unique in that while moving it will adjust the route automatically, lets you preview the route, route planning with easy to add waypoints, accepts place marks, and offers a parking mark when you arrive.  I bought the Lifetime Navigation. 

Preview/Plan Routes!!  You can preview the route in detail.  Plus planning with uniquely easy waypoints - adding stops along the way - and routing between stops.  Most nav apps don't permit a preview of a route in detail.   It's helpful to see or get familiar with the road names and route.  Other nav apps only show you entire routes in one distant view.  Only when you hit ""Go"" can you see the route detail.  Beyond annoying.

Auto Reroute!!  When I go off the route due to detour, missed turn, or whim, it changes the route based on where I am - not where I should be.  It does so quickly, ex. in a neighborhood, if you miss a turn/road it will adjust the route to the next turn/road.  Fantastic when there's a detour or traffic jam, you just go elsewhere and it will keep you going forward from there. It does NOT repeat ""turn around"" over and over and direct me to Uturn at each intersection I drive past.  Can't cancel/restart a route, it's difficult while driving and usually they go back to the same route you got off of.  So I have to turn other nav apps off. 

Wish:  need a Watch app.  One with next route step view and hepatic turn indication.
(Like the Apple Map.)   

Thanks for a great app!",5

copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Good app offline,A good app and can use offline. Very nice.,4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Worst app ever,Don’t waste your money worst app ever does not work I paid for upgrades nothing works all they want is to sell you more stuff I am contacting Apple a tell them I want a refund this app is an absolute joke,1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Worked great overseas without cell coverage,"My wife & I traveled to Italy recently. Before we left the States I downloaded the map of Italy and identified our key destinations and the routes between them.

CoPilot worked perfectly our entire time in Italy. We did not need to use any cell phone coverage. CoPilot knew every little road we took & when we made a wrong turn it always led us back. 

The only time CoPilot got confused was when we were in a big city with tall buildings around & my phone lost the GPS signal. That could happen with any GPS device, however, so I don’t fault CoPilot. Once my phone caught the signal, CoPilot was right there. 

I particularly liked having the routes planned in advance. When we traveled off the beaten path, I could easily retrieve a saved destination and, bam, CoPilot would route us there. Easy-peasy. 

Since we do not speak Italian, CoPilot gave us, me in particular since I did all the driving, a lot of confidence on the road. No need to have a road map open. No stress over asking, “Is this our exit? On what street do I turn? How do you spell that? Ack!” CoPilot gave us plenty of advance notice & clear directions. Whew!

I recommend this app.",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Used to be better,"It seems with each update i find more bugs, wrong routing, roads and interchanges that are inaccurate and the occasional route in circles with no resolution.  I found the app to be nearly useless in South Miami, Phoenix, and New Orleans.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Thought was a Free app?,"I downloaded this app trying to compare with WAZE, first thing I notice is that you have to pay for voice after the free trail. Ah... WAZE is freeeeee. Didn’t even try it, deleted the app right away.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Can't Recommend,"The first trip using this app was 40 miles with the camper in tow. I had set up my profile for the RV. This app tried to turn me into a pasture, twice. I had just paid for the unlimited voice package. Can I get my money back?",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,"Great app, but no iPhone X support",It would be five stars if there were iPhone X support. It’s been out for over four months and I’m still dealing with black bars at the top and bottom.,2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Great GPS APP,"I am a trucker and I've been testing this GPS for about 3 months now. I know it's not designed for trucks but I use it along my truck GPS anyway. I recommend it for anyone that's always on the road across the country , specially in places where there will be no data connection. You can set up a profile for an RV which can help avoid restricted roads, I've only had a couple of instances where it took me to a restricted road , but ultimately you  should never rely 100 % on any GPS . I like very much the next-turn feature , it gives you enough time to be in the lane you're supposed to be in. i really love that since I'm driving a big rig, I've tested it in most cities and works fine. There's been rare cases where it has failed to warn me of lane changes. I like the map color themes and other info display features. One complaint that I have is the 3D mode is barely 3D, I wish it was tilted at a lower angle a little further to give a 3D feel, as if seeing further ahead. Overall this is a great app/gps for its full price, it works everywhere and it's very reliable. Thanks",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Not free,After wasting long time to download it worked without guidance or turn to turn and asked me upgrade and this is only a trial version,1

copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Can’t find locations sometimes,"Sometimes this app cannot find very simple locations in S. California.  Maps need to be updated more often. 
Also would be nice to add the capability of record a routing so  we would be able to create a route that we like or use it when the route that the gps chooses is not a good one. 

Need improvement",2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Love it,It’s useful app,5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Very good and nice 👍🏼,I hope for copilot team to reduce price of guidance and navigating,5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Good to use....,"Good to use but be aware that you have to look at the route before 
“Following blindly what a machine tells you to do”. Always look before you leap/drive. I usually set up “way points” on the map. 

It of course is great to use in areas that are unfamiliar. Better than most but I usually cross check with google maps to make sure. 

Google maps use a data connection which copilot does not..saving data charges. Google maps will give you a satellite image/street view which copilot can’t. At least before you go you can check the easiest entry/exit points of your location with google. 

Information is knowledge. More is better on both accounts. For the price and convienace I can’t beat it.",5

copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.447,Nice app to have around,"Inexpensive gps app that’s nice to have. I’ve encounter situation where cellular reception  didn’t work and had to rely on copilot to find where I’m going.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.4.1.440,Only three stars.,"For on road navigation, this app gets you there.  With onboard maps, Worth the $10 for voice navigation.  Functions fine in Cellular dead zones, as long as your GPS is up and running.

It baffles me when I read reviews saying this app is the greatest... but when I buy the app, it's terrible.  Why would you folks give this a positive review?  Are the reviews verified?  If you can't trust the gps then why use it?  Hope I can get a refund...

Update - I received an email with some links on how to use the app and asking if I can help them to identify the bugs... This isn't a card game or face swap, this is an app that can cost you an untold amount of money in lost time and gas.  Please issue a refund.",1

I chose each leg of my route before leaving and saved them separately. Each morning I opened the route of the day. U did find a couple map mistakes, but I submitted them within it a problem. I did find that when attempting to plan my route with my iPad, the times were off, but it may be that due to the fact that there are so many settings.

I just found out they took all the themes out. So now not only did they screw up the app, that all of us have in one way or other INVESTED money, but judging from the email I just hot we are left holding zilch!!

The first test case gave me bizarre directions, carrying me past the usual exit and then doubling back on local roads.  My only explanation is that perhaps the directions are for big rigs, which is the real target of the ALK apps.

Down side is it names streets that are not there but yet gives u perfect directions to that street. 
I wanted to use it to set up an 800 mile trip. On the iPhone provided map it sets it up exactly how it should be.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.984,Overall a great navigation app,"We have been looking for something to replace our Garmin GPS DEZL (trucking GPS).  We were deeply disappointed when our Garmin stopped giving us good directions (I think Garmin stopped supporting it) and we started looking for something that could replace it. We looked at Rand McNally tablets but couldn't get past some of the bad reviews. So I tried this. We have used this through two states (on our iPad) and are very pleased so far. I like the fact that they have an RV and a Trucker version where we can set weight, length, width, and height restrictions in it. We are planning on upgrading soon to accommodate our trailer restrictions. My only complaint is that the speed limit indicator didn't work in one of the states (Indiana). This is slightly picky but I expect all aspects of the app to work when it says they will. That being said, I am very pleased with this app and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a versatile and programmable app for navigation, especially those who are towing anything.",4

Updating maps on other devices was either a ridiculously expensive process or a near impossible, slow, often-failing download then upload process.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.984,Great App!,I dive back and forth to Florida and this app that uses the internal gps in my iPad and doesn't use data is great. Way better than the little harming I have for situation awareness and finding alternative routes,5

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.984,Best Free Offline GPS,"CoPilotGPS is the best GPS. The map with all of the key locations (like gas stations, super stores, restaurants) are stored directly on my device. Plenty of FS roads on the map and the ability to enter coordinates. I wish I could give it more stars",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.984,Crashes WiFi when downloading,"The app works well. However, every so often when I update or switching maps it would crash my wifi connection. It often takes many times to complete a download, which has been very annoying.",3

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.984,"If you drive, you need this app!","Once you learn how to save your favorites, you will be able to build a route and optimize it for zero driving in circles. My productivity has doubled since buying this app. 

There are some drawbacks.

Some of the search functions seem over complicated, unless you're looking for a bar or restaurant.

You can't simply type a full address into the search bar, you have to do city or zip, then street, then number. Not a huge issue, but could be easier.

Over time the favorites seem to duplicate themselves. Again, this is no big deal, and probably something I'm doing wrong.

Lastly, gps is not a substitute for common sense. No gps is as accurately as you think it should be. This flaw lies at the heart of the  gps satellites and address registries, and not with any specific program.

Stay alert, watch for clearance obstructions, and maintain a safe following distance.

Drivers are found dead with their phones in their hands, with a gps program still running. Don't be a statistic.",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.984,Where's My CoPilot???????,"Been using this app for years and it worked great, TILL NOW! Latest update is a bust. Where are my favorites, why no voice at times and why so difficult to change screen size on the fly?",2

I have deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,A retrograde update,"I have used Copilot in North America and Europe for years. It was easy to use both to plan and execute a given trip.

The latest update is horrible. Nothing is remotely the same. Nothing is intuitive. It is clunky and slow.

I guess I got my money's worth but I don't want to use it until they fix it",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.984,Super app,"This latest CoPilot is a big step up and works very well. A brilliant app which I recommend to friends all time. If you live in an area with patchy cell service this app will revolutionize your driving because it doesn't need a connection to work. This means that it also works well when you are want to not use roaming data, like when you are overseas. It downloads the maps in advance and only uses the gps. This is awesome.",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.984,Search Fail,Major design flaw of only searching current location or specific city.   Will not search map being viewed. Excellent except for this flaw (do the designers use the product?),2
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.984,Offline maps that work!,I've tried other offline maps and none of them seem to work very well. None of them allow me to customize my own routes. Instead the app picks it's own route which is usually way out of the way and then the alternate routes are even worse. I can set waypoints with this app unlike others I've tried. My only gripe is the ETA is off. It calculates my trip that is supposed to be 10 hours as a few hours later.,5

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Best app ever,I've been using copilot for about 3 years and have never had any problems. It always gets me where I need to go,5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Worthlessness offline maps,"Offline maps never let you down?  How about never works.  On offline it thinks your 10-20 miles behind where your really at, think your on the next road off when your not. It's garbage get google maps and save the headache",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Latest version is a huge step forward,I have always required an app with offline maps since cell coverage is so spotty in the Appalachians. The previous version was laborious to perform route planning but the recents upgrades make impromptu routing a snap. Think everyone will Love it.,5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Just shy of worthless,"The ONLY redeeming quality to this app is that its maps are already on my phone.

Over the years of having this app, it's been waaay more frustrating that using google maps and losing the data signal -rendering it useless.

Entering an address can be a serious challenge. If copilot doesn't like your entry, it simply disregards it and offers a few that might be kinda sorta close-ish to what you're looking  for. One of the options offered is to use a contact, which is great... if copilot likes it.

I drive a big-truck and I have contacts, with addresses, for businesses all over the USA. The addresses I have are provided by the companies themselves, and I'm pretty sure that they know their own addresses. And, both google maps and apple maps can find these addresses, and get me there every time. I know what you're thinking, then just use those. I do. But, it's always nice to have a map already on my phone, because sometimes I need to be on a phone call and with Sprint/Verizon it can be a matter of one or the other, but frequently not both. Also, I like some of the options that copilot offers.

The speed limit option only seems to work in a few states, and quite often they're wrong because the state had increased its limits. I'm thinking that months is more than enough time to have corrected the changes. Yea, I know, copilot relies on its users for help in updating and correcting its maps -which as far as I'm concerned is bunk.

If I could have gotten my money back all those many moons ago, I would have.

Perhaps it works well for those who stay within the limits of their city, but the whole idea behind using a map is to get you from where you are, to wherever it is that you wish to go, and with copilot it's a hit and miss kinda deal. Not good enough. Frankly, my wife uses waze and seems to be quite satisfied. Sure wish it worked for trucks.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Works flawlessly in USA and Mexico without cell service,"I have relied on copilot for several years while living in Texas. Several months ago I retired to Mexico. Although Copilot's Anglicized pronunciation of Spanish street names is a little jarring, the directions are spot on. Another feature I really like is that the map database (or selected portions if you are tight for storage) can be downloaded and stored on your device. This allows me to navigate accurately in US national parks, foreign countries, and other areas lacking both wifi and cell service. I did have one problem with the app that required contacting tech support about a year ago. The problem was completely resolved by removing and reinstalling the app. No problems after that.",5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,"This is fraud, apple should be ashamed",I and my wife paid for this app. The audio does not function. Absolutely no sound. Audio just worked once. This app is a total fraud and a waste. Apple should be ashamed of them selves for allowing this consumer fraud.,1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Great App but Needs to be More User Friendly,"I don't use the app that often but when I do I really need it to work. Thus far I have been impressed with the navigation. I used it in October for a long road trip to backwater USA and it worked like a dream! However, I do wish it was more user friendly. The app itself is extremely difficult to navigate and not at all intuitive. For someone who doesn't use it all the time it is very frustrating to try to figure out everthing all over again when you need to use it. Please, PLEASE, make this great app even better by making the menus more intuitive and user friendly.",4
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Works well,Nice! Traffic is sweet,5
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Ok app bad customer support,"They upgraded their app so the one I had on my iPhone 4 won't work on iPhone 7. I had no way of transferring my purchases to the next app and after countless email exchanges, nothing has been resolved. I'm not paying for this crap again! It's supposed to be lifetime. Now their website is impossible to login to as well as the new app, bad servers OMG!

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,I shouldn't have upgraded it.,"This app was always accurate up until the latest upgrade. Now the eta is way off, a 30 min drive showing 1.5 hours, the routs are not as accurate, and the drag rout feature went away. They should have left it alone. If it ain't broke don't fix it. The search engine was changed to yelp, now it's useless. There needs to be a way to go back to the last version. Very disappointed in what was a good app.",1

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Good offline navigation,"I am using on I iPhone6. When I cancel navigation the app crashes often. Still, I like it. There is a confusing message sometimes when it says ""keep right"", when it is in fact keep straight. At other times it gets you to exit, and then puts you back on the freeway(??!!@$).
In some neighborhoods it puts you a block or two from your address. I commend the Help Crew for promptly responding to my issues! In brief, it works for me 95% of the time, still! Improve the above points for 4 stars.",3
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Completely Useless,"I downloaded this app a couple years ago because I could use it without the internet, just GPS.   I don't have service on the phone, I just use the phone itself.  Now I went to use it for the first time in a year and now I can't use it because it requires that I login and why would I want to log in to view a map using GPS?  I used it to ride the bus and see where to get off the bus but now I'm blind and have no idea.  I wish apps were not allowed to change the fundamental features of their app.  I'm so sick of downloading an app and then in a year or two it's an entirely different app that you can't use so why buy apps when the app makers destroy what you bought.  To me, that is fraud!",1

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Screwing up a good app -- misunderstanding the customers,"I switched to Copilot a few years ago after Telenav totally screwed up Telenav GPS and Scout by messing with the interface and removing features important to business users.

Now the developers of Copilot have made the same DUMB mistakes, so I'm deleting Copilot and moving on.

I could get used to the UI changes, but switching the online seach function from Google to . . . What? Yelp? . . . is bafflingly stupid.  And not giving users a choice of which search engine they want to use?  Really?

(HINT:  not everyone uses GPS to find restaurants and clubs to connect with friends after work.)

The beauty of Copilot used to be this: when you couldn't find a destination in Copilot's built-in database,  you could type (or better: dictate) the name of the business (e.g., a lawyers office, or plumbing supply store) into the Google search box, click on the Google result, and Copilot would automatically capture the business' address, plug it in and start plotting the route.  No more, because (1) and somehow this may come as a surprise to the developers:  Yelp is NOT AS POWERFUL as Google, and (2) to be honest, Yelp doesn't really care all that much about businesses that aren't dining or entertainment venues (so good luck with that plumbing supply store).

The two litmus tests I now use for GPS apps: (1) do the developers insist that you authorize them to track your whereabouts, by turning on location services, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING THEIR APP?  If so, I click on the little ""x"" and delete the app.   Three words: NOT DOING THAT.  (I'm looking at you Waze, and others) 

Litmus test #2?   I type the name of locally well-known business I visit regularly into the search box.  Does the GPS accept business names or just addresses?  (If it can't deal with business names, app gets deleted.)  Then, does the app accurately find/identify the business?  (If it offers only one suggestion 900 miles away . . .  Yup, you guessed it: app gets deleted.  And finally, can the app automatically capture the business' address to plot the route?  (If it makes me type in the address, app gets deleted.)

We are way, way, way past the days when users were forced search for a destination in the Google app, remember the address, then switch to the GPS app and type, or cut & paste, the address into the GPS destination box. These apps are supposed to work for us, not the other way around.

So, goodbye Copilot, hello Google's own GPS/mapping app.  It passes all the litmus tests, and IT JUST WORKS.",1

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Great app til recent update,I've used this app since 2013 with few complaints. They recently updated it. Very difficult to use since then.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.950,Customer Support WORST. DOES NOT EXIST,Used this for years. Got new iPhone 7 and license did not transfer. Transfered on every other phone. Yes license is transferable too. So that's not an excuse. Had lifetime navigation. 3 emails No response.  Had to buy new license. Don't buy. They lie and charge you twice.

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.936,Disappointed with the update gps app,I am very disappointed with the updated version of CoPilot because the photo navigation feature has not come back. The app and USA+Canada maps are much bigger 3.03GB (about 720 MB more than before) and the menus is more confuse rather than easier to use.  It is difficult to upload snap photo for future map correction.,2

copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.936,Excellent...but not perfect,"I have now used CoPilot for two lengthy driving trips in Scotland, and found it to be both accurate and easy to use. That it doesn't play through the car radio is a major disappointment and should have been remedied long ago.

What have you guys done!! Please fix it,1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.923,Great application got better.,"The new interface is a good improvement,  I use CoPilot to plan trips and its save and load feature and international map options wins over its competition. 

One aspect of the load trip operation it that it adds 'current location' as item one no matter what was the saved starting point. I consider this a minor inconvenience because deleting that item is very easy. 

Another issue I have had is that it seems very easy to lose a trip plan, so I use the 'Save' often when trip planning. 

The various Search features seem more capable than the previous version's searches.

The map's point-to and route-through-here is a superb improvement over the drag route operation, it does a good job of inserting it into the trip, and when it misses reordering the stops and way-points is very easy.

I would like the capability to see the distance and time betwen trip stops. If it can now I have not found it yet.",4

You could see all of your stops in an overview. Now to see the address it freezes the screen. When I have 15 to 20 stops and can't see an overview of my route this is useless. I will be deleting the app.,1
copilot-gps-navigation,10.0.0.923,Great app!!!,5 stars! Great app. Always improving to stay the best!,5
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Irritating,I don't want to se POI's but there is no way to turn themoff,1
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Happy,I love the app differently worth the money. I would have given 5 stars if the app offered current speed while in navigation mode. It only gives current speed when not navigating.,4
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Localización,"A manera de no complicarse, debería de ser un poco más fácil la manera de introducir una dirección, esto porque la bases de datos no está actualizada al 100% y en ocasiones lo que se busca no es encontrado. Consideró que si se a donde voy con solo tocar el mapa me podría facilitar las rutas más rápidas.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Works well most of the time,The best GPS navigation app with full maps installed. Voice is good. Maps work well most of the time.  We got stuck in Maui on a dead end road  that took us an additional 30 min and Google maps to get back to our hotel.,4
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Too slow to be good,"Maps are good with a lot of details. Map zoom too slow and frequently accidently close app.
POI lookup is poor and doesn't recognize your request in case you change words order.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Nice app,With all features I need,5
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Great for poor cellular areas,"When traveling within the US, there are still large areas where cellular coverage is still spotty at best. So having maps downloaded is a huge benefit. I do wish I could customize the route in an easier way, as I travel on a motorcycle. Perhaps in a future release.",5
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,No the best app to say the least,"Fortunately I didn't bought the app but I have used the 7 days free trial. I have used it to get from Bologna to San Gimignano, in Italy. After 40 minutes of driving and 5 Euro highway charges I was still on the outskirts of Bologna. I had google maps running in parallel on o different phone and the indications where not matching.
Plus the interface is confusing , at least.",1

You now have to scroll to the bottom of your stops to add another. I do 60 a day it drives me nuts. You can no longer just click and move a stop up or down in the rotation your city selection no longer stays in you must start to type the city every time.

copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Co-Pilot,"I was looking for an app to use on my wi-fi only ipad and saw this app which was exactly what i wanted. I use the garmin-glo add on gps as the wi-fi version ipad mini does not have a built in gps. I use my ipad on my boat with navionics and it works great so i figured it should work with co-pilot and it does work.
I had to drive my daughter to usf in tampa and i was more than impressed with the performance of this app, very detailed and smoothe. I love this so much i had to give it a ten star..lol.If you are looking for a reliable awesome navigation app, this is the one, there are many out there but this one does a very good job for me, thank you co-pilot developers, excellent job.",5

copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Really?,"This app is not written for iOS, it is something ported over. It lacks every address I entered. For some strange reason it wants me to leave my house and travel down a tiny alley instead of the street in front of my house when I try to plot a trip. It makes me wonder where else it is going to route me on a real trip. I can't find a way to plan a trip so that I travel on the roads I wish to travel on - the waypoints seem to have to be an address so it wants you to get off the highway. It is the most awkward interface I have ever seen on an iOS app. I have many more issues with this app after trying to plan a simple route, but in short, I just gave up and deleted it. A paper map would be easier.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Love It!,This app is better than the map apps included in my iPhone. The graphics are much better. I used to use Maps and Google Maps to navigate but now I'm using CoPilot GPS. Best decision ever.,5
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Great App & Customer Service,"I bought the free version of CoPilot some years ago but never used it. Then on a trip to Connecticut, a Garmin failed, and while my wife drove, I navigated with CoPilot, which took us to within one house of our destination.  I bought the unlimited voice-navigation feature the next day.  .   Just recently, I lost the Voice Navigation, then couldn't log in (a complaint of someone els below).  I contacted support and found them very helpful.  It turned out that my account had been corrupted; the simplest solution was to choose a new email login and
 when I did that support (Ashley) restored the lost Voice Navigation.   

I still use iOS 6 6.1.6 on an  IPhone 3GS. CoPilot deserves a larger screen. for optimal use.  Still even with my thick fingers,  dragging to change routes  works well  and  the GPS navigates successfully even in areas without WIFI and  cell reception.  One thing I've noticed is that CoPilot acquires Satellites much faster than the Garmin in my wife's car, which can delay for minutes, a real problem if I don't really know how to start a trip.",5

copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,AWESOME MY NEW BEST APP,This out performed my old nuvi that I could'nt even get to work! It also was extremely better than my apple maps in that it has speak directions I don't have time to look where I'm supposed to go next in traffic that is not only fluid but fast!!!,5
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,"Off line maps=great, features not so good","Remote travel requires offline maps which this app does great. But, navigation is sometimes misleading by missing freeway exits of roads. Also, multiple features are only half implemented, eg vehicle preferred speed doesn't change travel time.???
Daft marketing to sell a specialized RV version with only two additional features and demand full payment from existing non RV version users. Annoying. 
Bottom line, expensive, works kinda, best option if offline maps are a necessity.",3
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,GREAT APP!!!,Best one I've ever seen!,5
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Soon,"Have had a chance to use it yet, but looking it over and studying it, feel it will definitely fill the bill.",4
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Useless now that they haven't updated the app to allow for importing routes via iTunes File Sharing,"I would give this app at least 4 stars based on previous experiences with it, especially the ability to import and load routes I've planned ahead of time on the computer. But they haven't updated it to allow for Apple's new requirement for file-sharing through iTunes. They've had over a year to add this into an update, but they haven't, so they get one star. Now there's no advantage to this map relative to any other free app other than having offline maps. But there are free apps that allow for this, so there's no point in buying CoPilot anymore. Get your act together guys. Seriously.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Perfect,"Seriously , because of this app , i travelled by car :
Portugal

copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Copilot app needs help,"I have used Copilot IOS app for about two years, and I am now giving up on it. Used it for cross country motorcycle, RV and car travel. Recently the app took me for a 10 minute detour to a highway that was lass then a mile away. This has happened multiple times in the past, out of the way routings for no reason.  Recently the app incorrectly named multiple state highways and had me turning onto other roads (twice yesterday) because it thought the highway I was on ended then started back up in a short distance, which I could see they did not break. Loading maps to local device is nice, but the network routing needs help. Also, I like to plan my own route and preciously the software pointed me in circles because it thought the waypoint was off road. Creating your own route takes wY too long and has to be done on the device. Very frustrating!!",2
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.3.89,Works great for offline navigation,Great app. I downloaded North America map and used it between NYC and Montreal. Worked great!,5
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Direction list is not working after recent update,"Looks like no testing was done for recent iOS version, used to work great but not anymore. Goes back to previous screen when I click direction list option. Please fix ASAP.",2
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,"Gone downhill, wants money now","I've owned this app for years & now they want money to continue using it. The whole point of BUYING an offline GPS system is so you do not need a data connection & you do not have to keep paying. Too bad, deleting it.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Nothing works!!!,"Copilot gps is an excellent product, put out by an impenetrable, infuriating, utterly frustrating company. Love  the concept, absolutely hate the system. Some time back, I had to delete and reinstall the app on my iPhone. Since then I haven't been able to log in and get at all those perfectly swell features inside. No matter what I do, I. can't  reset my password--nor can I get past the dialogue boxes. I'm in an endless loop and ready to frag something. PLEASE PROVIDE DIRECT EMAIL ACCESS TO SOMEONE WITH A PULSE. Canned FAQs are never enough by themselves.",1
copilot-gps-navigation,9.6.4.100,Quite disappointed,"I'm disappointed because there is no way to buy a particular region in Europe. If you only want to use it in one or two countries, you have to buy the full map of Europe. Not to mention that you have to buy the full application. All in all it cost around 45 USD just to be able to navigate in one country.",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Our go to app for RVIng,Twenty years ago we retired and began RVing four to seven months each year. AllStays has revolutionized the way we plan our trips. After owning every size and every combination of RV we have settled on a 25’ Class C with solar panels. Our rig fits in everywhere. We now plan on the fly which has saved us during the summers out west that have been plagued by wildfires. We have always found space using AllStays and I must admit all have been excellent.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Jim Foley,Best site we’ve found for planning our trips.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Well worth the subscription!,"Traveling solo in my little vintage class C, I use this app daily to find places to dump, places to shower, safe places to park for the night, info on pet-friendly campgrounds, propane refills...even steep grades and low overpasses.  Incredibly useful.  Hats off to the developers - they deserve to be paid for their work.  Reviews of sites are great - especially if you are traveling alone and want to stay safe.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great App,"We use this for everything. Not only shows all campgrounds, but low clearance, food, fuel and overnight parking. I highly recommend this app.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,On the road 2,Makes our travels so much easier. We like the freedom of not making reservations far in advance tying us to a more ridged schedule. The app has always provided accurate options to suit our time schedule when and where we choose to travel.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Excellent Travel App,"Traveled from Houston to the Canadian border and back, and this was my go-to app for information.Was always able to find a place to stay it suited my needs. Was even able to plan gas stops at Sam’s or Costco while traveling through the larger cities. Would not go on any trip without it.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,We use this app all the time!,"Allstays  is our go to for camping spots! We have been using this app for over 6 years. We can look at pictures, reviews, specs, etc. of each site, and all the information is there at your fingertips. We are in a motorhome, so we need to know our rig will fit and have the power we need. Thank you for providing a great app. to make traveling easier!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great app,"We used this app tons when we traveled from Colorado to Nova Scotia. Became on of my best, go to apps for information.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Well worth the cost,"I don’t pay for apps often, but this one was a good buy, especially for Walmart availability, casinos, and dump stations. No app is perfect, but this is my go-to for overnight stays and utility essentials.

Could use more propane listings, especially hardware stores and TSC (Tractor Supply Company?) stores that have propane, often at the lowest prices.

Wish they could also do an Android app that I could get on my phone.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Slow map loading,"Very slow to load Google maps lately, despite every other map app that uses Google maps on my phone not having an issue.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Could be even better!,This is a terrific ap that desperately needs a “Favorites” function.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best App for traveling,"Traveled around the US in a Class A RV , what ever we needed I went to this app, for  RV sites, Walmart’s for over night stays and shopping , Fuel gas, diesel or propane, pump outs , repairs , etc.. Best $$$ spent on an app.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,L. Allen,Very useful app - I learned of it from a friend who is a frequent camper and I highly recommend it as well.  We’ve used it for cross country trips and it’s always been accurate.  A really great feature is the bridge height info.  This was critical for our safe routing in New England and some mid-western states.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Waste of money,"I found the app difficult to use and wasted more time trying to figure out the app than if I had just called places. The few times I did use it, it was not accurate (I.e. the gas station didn’t have potable water or dump station) wish I could just get my money back since I used it just a few times before getting annoyed.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Useful but expensive,"The Allstays website is terrible, so I resisted paying for this app for a long time. I’m pleasantly surprised to see that the app is MUCH better than the website, but it could use some improvements for the price tag. 

I wish it would remember my filters each time I restart the app. I also wish I could just select all filter items and uncheck a few.

I don’t understand how some parks have ratings with no reviews, but I can’t rate a site without leaving a review. For what it’s worth, I don’t always have the energy to put together a well worded review, and I wish it were possible to just rate key factors (noise, cleanliness, safety, level/ease of parking overall comfort).

I also wish I could flag certain entries for review by admins. One park I found is tent sites only but Allstays says full hookups etc. Another park I found isn’t a park at all— it’s a parts store. Yes, it’s great that there are so many data points in the database, but it’s it’s 2020– let’s talk about quality, not quantity. 

I won’t use this app exclusively, but I’ll use it along with several others to help make travel decisions. 

I wish I’d paid $5-7 for this app. $10 is very high, but at least it’s a one time fee and not a subscription service. Grateful for that.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,On the Road Again!,This app makes my life so much easier when we’re on the road.  It is my go to app for all things RV! 👍👍,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Very Good but needs A few things,"This app is very good, but it really needs a trip planning option. Applying the great filtering to aroute rather than one area at a time would be worth a few more $. It also needs an Android version.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,LOVED last version but NOT this version,"When I click on a RV-site symbol, the info box pops open upper left corner and MOVES THE MAP - jumping the symbol I clicked on to the bottom edge — terribly annoying because I lose my place on the map and have no control over what is in the map frame.  The old way was much better — it opened the info box right above the symbol I clicked on.  Seems like a minor point, but if it isn’t fixed, I won’t be using this otherwise great APP anymore.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Almost Perfect,"We have used this app a LOT from the moment we purchased our very first camper two years ago, and it has been extremely useful.  I really don’t have any complaints about what it DOES offer, but rather a suggestion for what it doesn’t.  We pulled our camper up through Colorado last weekend through a snowstorm.  By the time we made it to our destination our camper was covered in thick layers of mud and ice.  The ice has all melted, but the camper is still very muddy. I looked into having someone come to the park and wash it for us but, good grief, $450?!?  This app is seriously missing out on a big part of RV’ing.  It really needs to also show locations of car washes that have high bays and big parking lots so that RV’ers know where they can take their mobile living quarters to wash them themselves.  That particular feature would be MOST helpful!",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,4.6 . . . Not sure why!,"I don't get why this app has a 4.6 rating and suspect I'm either missing some integral help aid or others are just not searching the way I search. I don't find the search bar helpful at all. When entering ""Texas, Dallas, Copper Breaks State Park"" which of course are all known to exist the map moves slightly, but doesn't necessarily center on the search item.

If you hit the drop-down in the upper right corner, but do not know the affiliation of a park its use is also of little assistance. I attempted looking for a park listed in the Forest River Forum referred to as ""South Llano River SP"" (State Park) and never received even a hint of a hit, yet a Google search clearly identifies the park.

I'm going to keep playing with it, but honestly think Google Earth or other search tools are more effective than All Stays. 

I think this app begs for more handles and tools to assist the user.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Has been the dest app to use,"Use ever time I change destinations, always have found a good place to stay",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Must have app,"For any RVer. I love being able to search on the map and then click to pop up information on a specific campground. It suits the way we plan. Also really appreciate the addition of low clearance and rest stops plus BLM. After 3 years of almost full time I’ve only found the app to have inaccurate information 1 time.  

AllStays developers!  The improvements I’d like to see are to be able to save a trip and mark favorites for the trip. Plus it would be fantastic if you could integrate harvest host locations!",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Very helpful!,"Every time I plan a trip I use this app. I look up where the best campsites are where I’m I going. Anytime I need to know where there is a Walmart that allows boon-docking just in case I need to stop on the way. There was an occasion I needed to know if there was any low bridges on my route, I didn’t want to get stuck. It has everything you need to plan a trip, and it’s super easy to use and understand!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Awesome app,It is my go to app for RV travels!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Simply the Best,"We just started using this app and WOW have we ever been missing something big without it.  Best and most comprehensive app I have ever seen to help guide us along the way.  It tells you wberhthing you need to know along your route, like campsites, dump stations, truck stops, Walmart’s and so much more.  Don’t cheat yourself and get the paid version to get it all and to help these folks continue updating the program.......
WELL WORTH IT!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,MY MOST FAVORITE APP!,For the last 5 years I have used this app everyday while traveling full-time. All the information you need in one convenient easy to use app!

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Excellent App. Use it on a Daily Basis when traveling,I would be lost without this app. I’ve tried many other apps but this is my go to for finding overnight places.

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,GREAT APP,"Great APP for travelers. We used this app to find RV Parks, campgrounds, and overnight parking as first time RVers and found it to be accurate and informative. We use it all the time. Like that we’re able to give feedback on the sites we used based on AllStays information. I’d recommend this app to anyone wanting camping information. We travel in a 34’ travel trailer and finding spots to accommodate our RV’s length was easy using this app.",5

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Good but not great,"This is often touted as the “best” of the campground/campsite location apps and I agree. But the images displayed are not always accurate. I have seen the exact same photos in the images for one campground in the images for different campgrounds. I want to see what the campsites at the selected campground are like, not pictures of nearby campgrounds or the local tourist traps. And local attractions can be found doing an internet search.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,One of the best apps I have ever purchased,So very useful if you are a full time RVer.   My wife and I where on the road for two months and this is the only app we used to find what we needed.,5

Very straight forward and easy to use and so far all the information in there was up to date. I don’t always manage to master the “search” feature as another user said . Needs to type in the town , state , and even country sometimes ... though no guarantees it will work  . However my greatest wish is for this app to have a FAVORITES BUTTON.... and probably I emailed the developer every single time they released a new update for the last 6 years or so... still nothing .... kinda’ disappointing ....  Often in our travels we stumble over a hidden gem of a campground that we might not be able to camp at for different reasons and wish I could save it to a favorites list for future visits ... When you cover thousand of miles in one road trip is kinda hard to keep up with all that ...    wouldn’t be wonderful to be able to have your favorite campgrounds in one place -especially when planning for a road trip and need to keep track of your itinerary  and camps booked along the way in the middle of nowhere - instead of taking notes on a piece of paper ( and misplacing them )  .... especially when the “search “ button can’t always keep up with the job ... and certainly unable to search after campgrounds names later ... please, add a FAVORITES button !!!!  You claim you listen to your customers ... Not only you do not listen but now once EVER someone replied to my emails to at least let me k is that I’m wasting my breath... so  I’m not sure what do I need to do in order for that to happen because apparently emailing you every few month with a basic app request  is too challenging for deaf ears ... very disappointing . I’m sorry you fail to see the importance of such feature ... maybe you should get out and test your app in a real life scenario ... thousand of miles away from your home ... that will probably do . 
So ZERO ⭐️ for customer service 
     4 ⭐️ for the app for lacking a “Favorites” feature  . That leave you with 2 ⭐️... A real shame for an otherwise ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ app... !",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,You need this app when RVing.,Love this app. We’d be lost without it.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Travel assistance,"Have used this app on one cross country trip and as a camp ground search app and have had zero issues it works exactly as described and showing the gas stations is perfect we pull a 35 ft travel trailer with a gas tow vehicle so not only being able to find stations but a quick flip to satellite and you can get a good idea if you can actually get in to the pumps, over all great app!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,A really helpful tool,This is my go to app any time we take our camper on the road. It has worked well for us although either I’m not using it correctly or there are some things I would change. Regardless of my minor issues it is a priceless tool for finding campgrounds any where you might be traveling. For us it has been helpful in both the U.S. and Canada.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great app for RVing,"This is the best for campground info
The only thing lacking is road mapping , I have to use another app to map my routes and AllStays to find campgrounds along the route",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,All stays,"I like the variety of campgrounds that you can chose from. We just got back from 4 week trip with camper and recommended this app to many people on the trail. Love pics you can bring up of each campground, that is the deciding factor for me if we are to stay there.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Retired to Travel,This is my major planning guide for 6 years. Thanks to the creators for a job well done.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great app,This is the best trip planning app I know. I use it regularly.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best App,"Use this pretty much exclusively...like the filtering, but wish they would make it so it could be a permanent setting..",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Allstays,"I love this app, we use it all the time while traveling !",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Thank you,Allstays has been a great help when other maps aren't available. You can watch as your vehicle  moves along the route on the phone screen. Thank you. And it tells you how many miles away the campground is from where you are located. Thank you!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great App,We travel six months out of the year and use this app daily when we're on the rode. Would recommend to everyone. Love this app,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,The Very Best!,"I have tried other apps, but none come even close to this one!

I travel in my Motorhome about six months  out of the year and this app is indispensable!

Very accurate database!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST APP FOR TRAVEL!,3 years ago we went full time NOMAD & I have used this app every single day. Even if we’re camped for a few days I still use it to decide where we’re we going next. If you’re doing any kind of traveling it is worth having in your app Arsenal.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Almost everyplace is here,I have been using this app for a couple of years now and have grown dependent on it. However not everyplace shows up here and I check other apps as well. I see that it opens to the area that you are I. But I use it for planning trips and the app opening to a much larger area would work better for that. By much larger I mean state or nation then I can quickly zoom in to the place I want to head instead of having to back out then zoom in toward the location I’m headed.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great app!,"We rely on it for locations for fuel, propane, walmart, rest areas and RV parks.  Easy to use and accurate.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Must have app for living on the road!,I’ve been using this app for year now. I come from using maps and my GPS and to using this app has help me out in locating a nice quite campground away from traffic with showers to right off the main highway for a quick power nap and back on the road. I strongly suggest anyone that spends as much time on the road as me to have this app as a back up or a quick look to what’s near you or on the way.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best RV camping App,"I use this app all the time! I have found it to be very accurate and the reviews are very helpful. By far, the best RV app out there!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Works great,"The only improvement would be to add additional options like links to Havest Hosts, Boondockers Welcome. It’s a great app and I use it first",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best nav app for RVers,This app has allowed us to travel all over the US and stop in many interesting places. Information is complete and accurate. User reviews are trustworthy. It has replaced my navigation app for finding rest stops and what is at the next exit. It is frequently updated and improved. Thanks!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great App,"We have been using this app for over 6 years. It has been perfect. It has saved us lots of time and money. I recommend it
To everyone on the road.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Reliable and Comprehensive,I have been using the app and pc version for the last seven years in my travels across the United States. This is the best tool I have found to help plan my trips.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best RV Travel App,My husband and I traveled for a year in our RV. We are seasoned world travelers and found this app to be absolutely critical in our daily plans and safe travels. We do not even recommend any other app. It has so many important features that a traveler who makes no reservations needs. We are not the type of travelers to go to RV parks so the features with being able to know where BLM land is are invaluable. We literally make no plans when we travel because all stays is so helpful in every aspect. The Adventure Travelers,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best App for RV Camping,"Have found the app to be useful, comprehensive and informative. Especially like the feature that allows you to view park specific images. It expedites Her Majesty’s approval or rejection of any given stop, planned or unplanned. I have two other campground apps on my phone that are rarely used other than to see if Allstays missed anything.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Worth every penny!,Essential app when traveling. The user reviews are good.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Awesome app but...,"Awesome app but, wish there was an easier method to submit corrections. As a full time RV’er I don’t always have access to email. Snowflower RV camp is NOT open year round. We just happened to get there before the end of the season. However, that might not be the case for others. But, with that said the app is extremely valuable for finding a spot on the fly for overnight, stores, propane, dumps, etc. Thank you for your efforts.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Very useful. Could be better,"This is a very useful app. I also use Alston’s 
Pro online. The only minor complaint I have is the map scaling. As one zooms in and out the scaling changes, as you’d expect,but the highway identifiers are lost so it can be hard to follow a highway to a destination, choosing sites along the way. One has to try and remember physical changes such as bends or geographic features to know what road you’re following. I suspect that the road identifiers are imported from a commercial database and the developer has no control over where they are located. As it is, if you zoom in to find a campground you’ll lose the highway identifier and you’ll have to zoom back out to see it.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Just need to add routing for 5 stars,Great database app,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Nice resource,It is nice to have a resource to help find out of the way camping spots as well as anything camping related.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Lifesaver!,A truly great app.  I’m a full-time RV’er and it’s gotten me into some great sites.  Worth every penny.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best App for Full Timers and adventurous Part Timers!!,"Features filtering to display only the info you want and displays it in a very clean easy to use and understand format. 

Makes finding BLM land, gas stations, and campgrounds all on one screen super convenient and easy for me/copilot. 

It can also show/filter specific store brands, propane equipped places, and all sorts of different types of parks (state, national, etc), RV services, misc dump stations, rest areas, truck stops and honestly much more than I care to list out. 

If you’re a full timer this is a must have app. Part timers will find it useful to find little hidden BLM land hideaways and see sites that are otherwise difficult to find via google like staying on the Army Corps of Engineers spots, and a wide variety of campgrounds the general public just doesn’t know about.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,So Helpful,"We’ve spent 6 months in the last 13 on the road & Ive not only come to rely heavily on AllStays, but use it almost exclusively. Love how it send you to Google or Apple maps that take us right to the campground entrance. And I read the reviews & have added my own. Great app!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great App,Always my go to app for camping. Thorough and accurate reviews.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,The best,I’ve been using this app for 3 ½ years now. It’s my go-to app when I want to check out RV parks or find a rest area or dump station.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,John and grace,We use this app to plan all our trips! Very functional app! All the data has been reliable for the 3 years we have been using it!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,"Lots of good info, but flawed","This app has a lot of good info, but the filtering feature is so ridiculously complex that it’s nearly impossible to filter out, say, campgrounds that don’t take RVs. 

But biggest glaring omission is that there’s no way to mark campgrounds as favorites... places you find here that you want to try when in the area!  This would improve the apps usefulness a lot.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best all around travel app for campers,Never leave home without it,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Using for more than just RV Parks,"Have been using the All Stays app for 18 months now, and have found it great for finding and booking RV parks. The app became invaluable, during an emergency we had last year, which required plan changes while we were driving down the interstate.
We also use it to find dump stations, in the Nevada/Idaho Great Basin area, where services are few and far between. Have it downloaded on both the iPhone and iPad.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great app,I’ve been using Allstays RV for about 7 years. It is so much better than the old books that we used to have to find campgrounds. This is the only app that I’ve ever actually spent money for. Best investment ever.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Indispensable if you are rving or camping,We have traveled by rv across the US and Canada a few months per year. We plan everything with Allstays Pro. All the info at your fingertips! It rocks!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Crazy Good!,We are attempting to camp in all 48 states and visit all the mainland national parks. This app a dream come true for camping with our tag along. Please put campground reviews on this site every time you camp somewhere!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best Value Out There!,"We’re full time RV’rs and we use this App almost exclusively for planning AND navigating (although I usually keep the GPS on as backup if we lose cell coverage or I want to know elevation).
I’m hoping that soon you’ll be able to link All Stays to your tablet  GPS when you select a choice of navigation map?
Anyway - highly recommended!!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great app!,I use this all the time. It has everything we need to travel. We use the Elks and Moose lodges a lot. Thanks for a great travel app.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Recommend!,"I whole heartily endorse allstays app . Once you learn to navigate the app it’s a treasure trove of travel information ( it’s not hard to learn to do!)

People using the app can add information to help keep things up to date. 

Need a restroom just scroll down the road & look for the R icon this will tell you if and where there is one on your route & the mileage to it 

Campgrounds, Walmart’s , repair shop, propane, fuel ,with reviews & the mileage to them.

And all easy to get the information you need.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Super helpful,This is a terrific application for finding and choosing the right Campground. This app and RV TripWizard (an online app) are incredibly for local and long-distance trip planning.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best App for route planning,"We use this app almost exclusively for finding places to stay, to double check our route for diesel stops (especially in Canada), check road grades and low clearances.  The filter feature is excellent for tailoring your search.  We use it with Apple or Google maps and have found no need for any other RV GPS.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,My Go-To App for RVing,"I've used this app mostly for finding camping spots I'd never heard of! I like that you can call right from the app, or go to the many links and back, with ease.  I've also used it for finding a place to dump - a real challenge at times. The ratings seem to accurately reflect what I've found.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Hi,I can’t imagine anyone giving this site a rating less than five I have been using this site for several years now I travel all over the country and I think this is better than Swiss cheese,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Big Rig fuel info? Not here.,For big rig fuel info this app is a waste of time. If you have a big rig and are looking for an app to help find fuel this app ain’t the one. It lists fuel stops but there no way to tell if you can get in and out without problems. And the images most often show nothing of the fuel station rather they shows local attractions.,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Good app,Don’t get to travel much but when I do I use this apt,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Must have for Fulltime RVers,We use this app everyday to find campgrounds. I also use it for navigation because i feel they do the best job listing high grade roads and low clearances. Must have for Fulltimers!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great app.,"This is our go to source when driving our RV. Very helpful, especially for info and services beyond campgrounds.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,So Helpful!,The only thing that would make this app a five star is if it had a trip planner.  Other than that it was a terrific app for finding campsites and gas stops on several of our trips.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best thing since sliced bread.,We would.be literally lost traveling around without this app. A plethora of very useful camp and travel related information. Priceless.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Travel buddy,"My go to source for going down the road. Everything I need in one app: what, where, what to expect once I’m there. Plan all our trips with it.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Since this spring it hangs frequently,"I have loved this app and used it for 5 years - rated it 5 stars, back then. Seems to have gone downhill since then and lost functionality. Sad",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Extremely helpful,I use this as I just wander around the country. Using the map as I move along is super helpful as it is for planning. I just did 3000 miles as it was a great resource. Gives adequate info to even pick sites! And I like solitude. It seems to be able to work when my phone doesn’t.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Bug Fixes Needed,Feature Request & General Problem Reporting not currently working.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great Help,"When planning a trip, this is the only app I use. Great information on RV Parks, travel stops, Road Grades, etc.
Don’t leave home without it.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Excellent,The best and up to date app for anyone traveling for any length of time.We have used it consistently for several years and it has never let us down.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Essential,I’ve used Allstays for two years and have found that it meets all the needs I have in planning a trip and finding a campground. We travel about a third of the year and this is my go to app.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Great app,I recommend this app to every friend that camps. Worth every penny.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,"This App is a MUST have. Highly, highly recommend.","Drove California to Key West, Florida never had a problem finding a place to stay. From Truck stops, to rest areas, to campsites/RV Parks, Walmart’s... I could go on and on. Gives you accurate addresses and phone numbers to make reservations ahead of time or just before stopping. Every place to stay you’ll find it right along your planned route.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.3,Best ever rv app,"I cant believe how much easier this app makes rv  life in planning and on the road. 
Its much appreciated.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Good app,Excellent resource. Sometimes I wish descriptions were more up to date but that’s up to the users like me to upload more comments.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Invaluable,"I used this app non-stop on my trip to Canada. I use it around my area, too, to look for RV resources. The icons— especially Costco for gas, Walmart for boondocking— help me tremendously.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Most useful campground app,Allstays has helped me find city or county campgrounds that are not part of the regular ‘chains’ like KOA or Good Sam.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Nearly useless,"I really wanted to like this App, but find it next to useless. Searching for a specific rv site is beyond frustrating. Search for Ohio (or whatever state) and the state centers on the map. Search for a site (State park, campground etc) nothing happens. You can find it by browsing the hundreds of campgrounds that appear when an entire region is selected but that is hunt and peck. Tried to contact Allstays support for add a feature or help and nothing happens, I guess that is there for looks.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Excellent Camping resource,"Reliable information. Integrates with Google Maps and Apple maps, so you can plan your route.
Great way to check for Rest Stops, gas stations, low clearance - even outdoor stores like Cabela’s along your route.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Absolutely necessary!,A must have while planning your travels. My only wish would be for it to have more reviews per campsite and if it could have a way we could pin our favorites or what we want to remember on the map for ourselves while trip planning.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,"Very Good, but needs some improvement","Overall the app is very good & I recommend it to all of my RV friends. I've been using it for about 3 years now and I live in my RV half the year wandering around North America. 
The main issue I have is searching larger areas than what shows up when you pick a State & town. Oftentimes nothing shows up for a town when there are RV Parks in the general area, but not listed for that town. 
Searching a region on the map page helps, but it's not always convenient if you don't know the area well. 
Again, it's a very good app, and 98% accurate. Just not always convenient to find a stop when traveling.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,RV most useful,"One of the most useful RV apps I’ve used. Using the map and applying filters to quickly find parks and reviews, dump stations, RV friendly Walmarts, truck stops etc. well worth the few dollars.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Excellent App,All Stays is indispensable for planning RV trips.  The reviews and info are very helpful.  Only downside is that the photos do not always match the campsite.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Limited application for boondocking,"If you are wanting to find places to stay without fees, this is not the app for you. 
The listings are heavily dominant with paid camping and parks. 
Boring. 
iOverlander is a far superior app for free camping and the app is free as well. 
I feel misled with this apps description and regret paying for it.",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Has most of the needed information...,"This app is pretty descent. Has the main campgrounds, facilities and such. Not much different from most map apps. However, this is a camp app, so why is there so many places missing??  They seemed to have about 60% of the dispersed camping covered, but lacks details on where it starts and stops.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great app!,One of 3 or 4 go-to apps for figuring out where I’m going next.  I’m amazed at the people who don’t even know about Allstays.  How do they ever plan anything?,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great App,Use it all the time all around the country.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Helps so much when traveling,We don’t set firm plans when we travel. This app shows us plenty of options.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Fabulous and accurate info,"Used it only for 5 days so far on our journey. Invaluable for deciding where to stay. Helped us with out of the way, excellent campsites for our truck camper.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,The greatest app on my phone,"This app helped me on my spontaneous crosscountry road trip to help me find places to sleep along the way. I didn’t need to interrupt my trip to scour the internet for camping. The app gave all the info I needed without cumbersome, bloated functions. Simple and gets right to the point, the way all software should be designed. Thanks!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,The only camping app that has everything,Sometimes hard to search for a place on it but otherwise it’s the only game in town.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,"Pretty good but be careful, some map campgrounds are wrong","I found a koa near Austin mn and book it. But found out that it thought it was the Hayward wi koa and I lost $10 cancelling the reservation. It should be the albert lea/Austin koa. Take away, you need to double check everything!!",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best Travel Companion!,"We just returned from an 8 week cross country trip with our new 27’ Sunseeker. I navigated hour by hour with no reservations, boondocking mostly but finding great campgrounds every few days to do laundry and rest. We saw this beautiful country in a way you can only see from the road. We knew where every rest area, gas station and Walmart were in our 7000 mile trek well in advance. I never could have done it without Allstays Camp & RV. I won’t leave home for more than 30 miles without it again.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Terrible interface and difficult to use!!!!,"Recommended by a friend. This is most expensive app I had brought but quality is worst than some of free apps!! To start of, app does not remember my setting, meaning everytime I open app I have to select/tap from a long list of options. And the results is not acute. Walmart for example, when I select ""Walmart only"" a lot of locations that show up on other setting was not shown. There are many free apps out there you can use that is better than this!!! Such ripoff!!! Should have check out other free apps first before purchasing this one :(",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Waste of money,"So far this app is very disappointing. I expected more. When I see stars indicating a review has been entered, it shows there are none. It pulls up photos from google... I could do that myself!",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Good information,"I love the link to the campgrounds websites for more specific information and to make a reservation. Or to know how many first come, non-reservable campsites exist. 
I see they include steep road grades and indicate severity by %.  That’s a real helpful feature for my trailering. 
I can’t say it’s not improve able. But it’s well worth the money!",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great,"Gives you many options for campgrounds, gas stations and more. Works perfect. Must have for traveling",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Not worth the cost,"Lots of missing campsites, and latest information is not being updated",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Not bad,Good app to have when in unfamiliar territory but not all fuel stations and campgrounds listed.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Review of Allstays app,We were looking for overnight parking around Orlando. This app shows a few in south FL. If you go to RV Parky app which is free app it shows several around Orlando. Free app is much more helpful than Allstays Camping app that we paid $10 for.,2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Becoming irrelevant,"This app is becoming more and more irrelevant every day. Plenty of other apps do the same thing in a nicer interface. This app is dated. The UI is very old and doesn’t use the standards. It would never be accepted as a new app. The campground reviews are usually years old, very few recent reviews in most cases. Doesn’t remember your settings between launches. Doesn’t track cell signal service like other apps do. Doesn’t let you filter by amenities like other apps do. Rarely gets updated. Campground and/or location search usually doesn’t work and it doesn’t use partial matching like other apps do. Doesn’t let you save favorites like other apps do. Starting to see the trend here?",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,We love it,"A comprehensive app that we rely upon when
We embark on a trip. Can’t imagine being on the road without it,",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,This App is Incredible,This app has it all.  Replaced all my books using this app.  So many great features.  So much information in one place.  Haven't tried to send the item to a google or Waze map yet.  Next trip out.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,The app to have,"This is the most complete app I have used. It has links to campground websites, reservations, directions w/GPS coordinates, reviews and even weather forecasts for the area. Includes both public parks and private campgrounds. Worth every penny!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Not worth $10,I want my $10 back.  I can get this info and more in a free app. How do I get a refund?,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great app,"I use this every time we set out on a trip.  Super easy to find a camp site once you’ve selected a general area.  We use it a lot for impromptu overnight stays when road tripping.  Reviews are accurate and helpful.  Links to reservation sites, photos, reviews, phone numbers make it easy to select and book.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Most Helpful!!,This APP is the ultimately Best APP for RV travelers! It’s well worth the cost of the app!!!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Limited,"Two major issues, no ability to filter by length or to save sites you like. Overall it’s OK.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,What happened to filters?,"I have the all stays all inclusive  for over 10 years. Looks like this one has gone the direction like the others to push out standalone users of this app, and force membership.

I’m pretty sure that’s illegal. We’ll find out.

I’ve met the owner and I sure hope he would not do something like that.  I hope to hear back.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great visual,I love the ability to zoom in on one big map showing where campgrounds and facilities are located! Traveling in Oregon this has been extremely helpful so we can quickly plan where to head on our next adventure while we are literally driving down the road.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Waste of money,This is not worth $10 and free apps such as iOverlander or FreeRoam do a much better job.  I cannot believe anyone would charge $10 for this crap.,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,"Overall good, wish we could mark favorites","We use this a lot when travelling and is an extensive app, but would love to be able to mark our favorites and those recommended by other people.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best for    “off the beaten paths”,"Show more of your mom & pops campgrounds.
Every place is getting bought out by big companies that pay GSams to highlight there.
This year camping has really exploited. Having a hard time finds spots without making weeks reservations.
I’m halfway full timer and it’s getting hard to find places .",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,This a must have app for those that travel full time,"This app provides tons of information on all kinds of different places to stay. We travel in a motor coach. This gives reviews, places to fuel, Walmart’s as well as other information for travelers. Also works in Canada and Alaska. Worth every penny.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Gypsy,One of the best apps I’ve ever purchased. Just did a run across the country and found every stay by using this app. Of all the locations we’ve stayed at we have only had one that was a buzz and was over rated. Couldn’t imagine traveling without it.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great app for finding places to sleep,I use this app all the time to find places to stop for the night. I don’t know what I would do with out it.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,I love this app,This app is my RV travel bible!  I use it to cross the country several times a year.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,5 Stars for campers :-),"I travel often and this app has been so useful for me. It helps find gas stops, parking areas, dump stations, camp grounds and more. Seeing the user reviews helps me choose an area to camp. I'd suggest this for any camper that enjoys traveling.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,So reliable,We never plan ahead and this app gives tremendous confidence and results. We have over 50k miles on our trailer and many nights on the road. This app is used every day. Thanks,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Mapping?,I thought this app would have a routing function so we can see what campgrounds are available from point A to point B. Disappointed. Unless I’m missing something,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Very helpful!!!,Very helpful! We recently traveled and needed one night stays to and from our destination. This was a lifesaver.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great App,We just started using the paid app. We have found it to a valuable planning resource as well as a newly asset on the road. It has helped me find propane and Walmart’s etc. I also use it to cross reference my route planner. The reviews are helpful as well.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Fantastic,This app is a great find. It has pictures and information. Well worth the money!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,AllStays is our go to app when we look for. Campground.,"Full-time RVers and whenever we are going to a new area, nearly all the time, we use AllStays as the initial app to hunt for sites.   Format is intuitive.   

There are many CGs not on AllStays and wish there was a way to have those added.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Worth the cost.,"This app has saved me so much headache while long haul road tripping for work with my camper. I use it mostly for finding smaller independent campgrounds and truck stops for staying overnight. Wish it had a better more intuitive review system, though.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best resource ever,Love this app.  We took a 5000 mile trip and are wandering around the USA.  This is awesome for finding campsites and other necessities.  I bought the $9.99 version.  Best $10 bucks I’ve ever spent.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Love this App,"I use this all the time. Not only for finding great campgrounds (public and private), but also places I can pull of the highway for the night without cost. I would urge people to communicate with the developer so that the data base can stay current.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Robust and reliable,"We have had a travel trailer for a few years. We enjoy boondocking but found it difficult to locate free/cheap camping across many of the free apps. When planning our cross country, month long trip, and seeing many raving reviews from full timing even families on YouTube, I decided to make the purchase. This has been an invaluable tool during our journey. We have used the app mainly for free overnight parking, dump stations, locating BLM land and determining if roads to/from the BLM area were maintained and passable. The ability to submit your own experiences leverages crowdsourcing, which keeps the information up to date and accurate. I have submitted many reviews during our journey.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Well worth purchasing!!!!,So far this has proved to be an excellent app.  Glad we got it.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Fantastic app!,This app is a lifesaver in a pinch. Tons of info well-organized once you get the hang of it. We spent 6 delightful days at a FREE place on a lake in Idaho that we'd never have found otherwise.  I just wish it were searchable by campground name; sometimes you know that but not the town.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Fantastic,We have been using the paid version for a couple of years as we travel the country in our Sprinter. This app is super accurate and makes life on the road a breeze.  Please keep up the good work !,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,AllStays Pro,"Just paid for it. Once paid for, no info on if it’s a separate app?  When I do find it and put preferences in it, they’re not there when I go back. Not sure how to even use AllStays Pro. 😫",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Not much different than using Google and Google Maps,Not sure why this app was $10 as it doesn’t have much value. Pretty much all the info is aggregated from Google anyway. The only thing it does differently as far as I can tell is gives you a campground icon on maps.,3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Wouldn't travel without it,"Have used this app since 2012. Over 100,000 miles of crisscrossing this beautiful country and Canada. Accurate 99% of the time. Comprehensive. Just fantastic easy links to directions, websites, and reviews.
Only disappointment is that I haven't been able to share the Android version of the app with anyone. Guess it's not supported anymore. We still have it on our phones but I do work off the IOS version most of the time. Also  seems that at one time, I could follow the location on the map by gps even without wifi connection on my iPad.
Always wanted to tell allstays how good this app is.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,A great resource,Basically this is my travel bible.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Wonderful App,"Have been using for years.  When you see a needed change (maybe a campground has changed its name, for instance) just send it in.  They will update it very quickly.  Could not imagine planning a trip without this app.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Thumbs up,Great app,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Does not have the features listed,Don’t waste your $$ on this - it doesn’t have any of the filtering features it claims to have,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,My go to,App I always use to search for RV camping.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Essential for the RV traveler,"Have used this app almost every day on the road, not only to find camping and parking spaces, but directions to Costco has, and dump sites. So helpful!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Let’s go south of the border! 🌵🌴,"I love this app so much that my only suggestion would be to please add Mexican waypoints. I would love to see camp sites in Baja, Mexico!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great site.,I have been using this app since 2013 when we got our first RV. so easy to use and find sites at the last minute. I have recommended this to many people who are new at camping. Thanks,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Additions !!!,Additional $30.00 for pro version for inclines and bridge heights. They don’t tell you that.,3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Love using this app!,We travel extensively and I depend on Allstay to guide me into remote towns and campgrounds. With a 44 foot RV we are careful about the roads and spaces we pull into. Allstay has been our lifesaver in numerous circumstances from the boondocks to the bustle of 8 lane highways of Chicago.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Super helpful,Great app easy to navigate,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great app!,"We used this in a cross country trip in 2014 and it was so helpful! Now we’re on our 2nd cross country trip using it and it has once again given us all we need to know about campgrounds, rest areas, and so much more! I really rely on the reviews of campgrounds to make my decision about where to stay. They have been right on so far!! The developer is very responsive to suggestions, corrections and additions! Thanks for this great app!!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Awesome App,"I love this app!! It has everything a camper needs, and so easy to use. I would never go camping without it. I also purchased the Walmart app but found that I didn’t need it because Walmart is already on this app. What a great source of info while traveling. Thanks Allstays!!!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Lost Info in Upgrade,"I am not happy with the new upgrade. Previously, the information window for RV parks and campgrounds would tell me size limits, if big rig friendly, and number of sites. That’s gone now, along with quick driving directions. Instead now I have to opt through the information window for a website or review site. Try that at 1 bar and 1x cell access and no internet. Good luck! I’ve had to lower my 5 star rating to 2 stars. We’ve used Camp & RV since forever, and I am SO disappointed in this change.

New review:
Why did you remove info on how many rv/truck parking sites available in a rest area? Now we don’t know if we can exit or not! Some rest areas are not suitable for our 40’ motorhome. I want my old Camp & RV app back!!!",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great App,Awesome app.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,A necessity for RV life,"We live full time in our RV and this is our go to for all places to stay, and also for gas and services. Makes this all practical",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great. Highly Recommended!,"This app has saved me a lot of money.  Find the city / county campgrounds - cheaper, better! Also the ACE campgrounds are always good.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,I LOVE ❤️ this app,We have a RV and love to go places with it. This app is the best for finding great spots! We are so thankful for it. Keep up the good work!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Go to app for full timer w/ class A motor coach,"I rely on it:
For gas stops that will accommodate a 34’ coach hauling a Jeep
To find campgrounds and free dispersed camping locations
To find RV dump stations
To avoid low clearance underpasses. 
To find overnight stay locations like Walmarts and rest areas.

The app launches:
Google Maps or Apple Maps with directions to your destination
Dials contact numbers
Launches websites

It’s a one stop shop for almost all my travel needs.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great app,Love this app.  Great even sites,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Indispensable,This is THE Go-To App.  I don’t know what RV life would be like without it.  A MUST-HAVE.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,A good app for RVing,I prefer the old way of providing information about a campground or other identifiers.,3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Class b camper,Best I have found to locate campgrounds any in USA.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,The Best? Really?,"Many of the free campsites and areas to dry camp are not listed on this app, and much of the dump info they give in the app is inaccurate.  Sorry I bought this app, better free apps are out there.",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Nice app,Pocket access to lots of information. Winner winner chicken dinner,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Potential to be great,"As a person traveling around the USA full time in my 5th wheel I use this app a lot and I like it but I want to love it and I can’t, here’s why. Although the app has the potential to be great there are several really annoying issues with it; the app freezes up fairly regularly and is so frustrating. The amenities setting that allow you to filter your choices based on your needs has to be reset every time you use the app, it would make life so much easier if they made them “sticky” settings so that you only change them when your needs change. You can only find campgrounds by city and I don’t always know what city we’ll be in or how to spell it if it had a region finder that would help tremendously and finally there is no way to save your selections if you are choosing between a few different campgrounds, the ability do do that would also help a lot. So it is a very useful app but it needs some improvements to make it great, upgrade it with the improvements and I’d be willing to pay up to $10.00 for it.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great,Great APP we use it all the time when we are traveling.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Finally a one stop camping app!,"I love this app. Not just because it lists every campsite, park, Walmart, rest stop, etc. but because it tells me how far away they are from where I am locate right now.  Gas stops are easy to plan too.  No more going through 4 different books and 3 different to find a place to stop! Best app for small amount of money!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,The Go-To App for Camping,"I’ve used many apps to find the best places to stay, but now I only use this one. It gives me every possible choice for boondocking or RV Parking, and the defaults narrow my choices. It’s easy, fast, and gives me the info I need.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Our main Go-To App,We use this app for every trip and it is the most reliable.  It provides all the information needed plus you can get directions from your location to the campground.  Best app ever!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best RV App Ever!,"Been using this app for the past couple of years now, and simply cannot imagine not having it. We use it extensively at home to plan trips, and do “what if” scenarios. And we use it on the road to find propane, dump stations, Cracker Barrel or WalMart stores, etc. Absolutely invaluable!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Love AllStays App!,"We use this app for all of our traveling needs. Whether it’s a place to stay, fuel, propane, groceries this app works great!
That being said, we have found mileage to be off the mark of true travel distance. 
We check our travel distances off of google maps rather than AllStays.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Use it. Love it,My go to app for #vanlife travel. Always helps navigate us to where we need to stop or even find supplies.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,"Must have for RV’er, camper, or traveler…","Must have for RV’er, camper, or traveler.  There are so many resources available on this app that anyone traveling can find useful.  I personally use this for RV’ing/Camping and use it for planning purposes.  I can find all sorts of camping locations from private to government locations.  To supplement my planning, I can find potential rest stops, gas stations, and most importantly potential hill grades and low bridges since I tow a travel trailer.

The application is intuitive to use and many filters to help keep the maps clean and easy to read.  I use this primarily on my iPad for planning on iPhone when traveling.  The campsite reviews are good, but I don’t know necessarily where the reviews are from AllStays or from another source. I use other site reviews once I find a location on this app.  

I would highly recommend this application.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Awesome app!,Just returned from a 7417 mile trip in my RV -Class B.  Used app dailey!  Love it!!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,New Version Disappointing,"Great app but much prefer the look and layout on the old pages for each campground, otherwise it’d be 5 stars.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Upgrade broke it,After latest upgrade my XGPS150-360AE1 is no longer recognized by the app. GPS works with other apps. Please fix it as this is my primary app for finding campgrounds on the road. It always says we are in the middle of the Atlantic of first southeast Africa.,3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Don’t leave without,"When we  travel with our RV we do not have a plan.  We use this ap to seek our next stop and reserve if needed.
Happy Camper",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Very Confusing,"I am using an iPad mini 4. In filters, I chose Thousand Trails, and Good Same. When I go tothe map, nothing shows. I can zoom all the way in or all the way out with all points in between. Nothing shows. I know there are several TT campgrounds and many Good Sam campgrounds but not a single one shows. And NOTHING else is chosen in filters. Not very useful to find a campground., Today, I ONLY checked Thousand Trails and if I zoomed in enough, it showed the two campgrounds in Ohio. I then added Low Clearance, went back to the map, and NOTHING showed. Very cumbersome to use and not very helpful. I did get a comment from APP support. Basically YADA YADA YADA try only one filter at a time. By clicking TT AND Low Pass, it will ONLY show TT that are ALSO Low Pass. How freakin useless is that?  So, it gets a 1 for useful only because nothing lower is allowed.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Disappointed,I was hoping to get other functionality with this app. Like saving reservations dates and times. Trip planning and adding stops etc,3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,All Stays,We used this App for over two years of full time RV travel around the USA and Canada. Allstays is an excellent source and replaced our paper books.  The RV-Military Allstays version was very helpful. For $9.99 it’s an incredible buy.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Perfect for Roadtrips,"If you’re traveling the US in an RV or even just sleeping in your car, this is THE app you need. For 10 dollars one-time, it’s a pretty good deal too. 

This app has information about Walmarts, truck stops, campgrounds, and even Cracker Barrel’s. Most places have comments from previous travelers which gives you more context for each place. Can’t recommend this app enough.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Don’t get it,"I expected more.  How is this helpful?  I want to plan a trip but can’t see the route in the app.  I do like some of the features, but for planning it needs work. Send to maps is also not working for me.  How can I use the low clearance locations if I am sent to another app?",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,My Go To App for camping,This App (purchased version) is my first stop when looking for a site.  Very easy to use with lots of good info.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Love this app!,I use it regularly.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,All change is not improvement,"Why did you ruin your app with an ‘upgrade’? It used to give a concise/brief description of the RV parks as to ‘Big Rig Capable, 50 amp service, etc’ without having to go to the RV park website.

Now you force that to happen. Much less efficient and user friendly.

Very disappointed.

By the way, you need to change the visuals on your app download page since you don’t get that information anymore.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best RV resource,"We’ve been using AllStays for several years now. Everyone we meet, we show them this app. Great sorting capabilities and the info is top notch. I plan our trips using this app as the primary source. We have updated some info to their site. Best resource we use.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Excellent site,"Simply put, this site will help guide you to find haven from the road!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best app for your traveling needs,"Our “go to” app for campsites, fueling, etc.  So happy we found this app before we began full timing almost two years ago.  It’s our number one reference!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,EASY TO USE AND ACCURATE,"I only have 7,500 miles on my odometer but I’ve only made reservations at my destinations.  The rest of the time I drive until I’m tired or see an interesting place. That’s when All Stays is is invaluable.  I highly recommend it,",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Fabulous APP!,We love how All Stays APP helps us discover and compare places along our planned or unplanned route. We’ve used it for over 5 years and can’t imagine planning or traveling without it. It frees us from needing piles of reference books and maps which were frustrating because they never showed the full range options which All Stays shows. Abundant thanks to All Stays for many memorable nights in unexpected places off the beaten path.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Full Timer,I retired 5 years ago and made the move to full time rv’er.  During this time I have been using the paid full version of the Camp & RV app. This app is such a part of my like style I would be lost without it. No matter where I am I am always able to find a place to park and spend a night or longer. The information is great and it goes a step further by linking to websites and online reviews.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Love this app!,"Used it all last year, and already started using it this year.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Don’t fix what isn’t broken,"Their latest set of updates made the user interface for searching absolutely terrible.   They should have left things alone and only updated locations.  I guess someone wanted to justify their existence- badly.

Before the update this was a great app.  It was extremely useful for finding campsites and places to stop along the way.",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Valuable travel tool,Use the paid app for our travel in a class A. So helpful and well worth the price of the app!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best Camp Guide Ever,"We’ve used the Allstays App for 5 years now and it’s been a life line for us!  We full-time travel in a motorhome-home is where we park-so knowing where to stop is crucial.  We do most of our travels and stops as we go, not much planning.  Ya know, you got us thru Yellowstone National Park, much of Wyoming and much of Montana last summer during the busiest tourist season ever!  Seriously, you’ve gotten us around the US a few times now!  Allstays has helped us find the best places to camp even if it was a Walmart.  The outline or synopsis of each place helps tremendously with details as hookups, length of rig, pullthrus, etc.  I like being able to see the reviews, hadnmt found them in the past. I’m adjusting to the new format-really liked the original so still adjusting. Very pleased.  Absolutely the best App for our lifestyle.  Thank You. ❤️. 
p.s. we share this app with everybody!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Extremely limited for a pay for app,"I found this App very limited and not worth the money. 

-Their search was cumbersome with no going back. To start a new search I had to exit then re-enter the app. 

-There are no settings 

-Have to set filters every time

-The reviews of places on the map on the app were few to non-existent 

-No direction were provided in the app itself, however, it did send you to other mapping apps

-We traveled the southeastern US from New Orleans, LA to Washington, DC and back by a different route for two weeks. We stopped at many campgrounds along our route. I bought this to help find campgrounds. I was extremely disappointed. This app didn’t show most of the campgrounds where we stayed. This app didn’t have information on so many campgrounds. Very, very disappointing. 

-This app worked well, not great, at finding truck stops that were RV friendly. It did not help us to find regular gas stations that were RV friendly. 

-The only restaurants it showed were Cracker Barrel’s.  Not all of these are easy access or friendly. They also are monotonous.",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Poor update,This app was amazing and made selecting a camp site so easy BEFORE THEY UPDATED IT. Since the update the features that made it so helpful (such as; if campground does tenting or takes RV’s and up to what size of RV.) have been removed from the  Pop-up info box on the main map screen. Now it is very hard to find this info.,2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Nice app but needs improvements,"The search feature just doesn’t work. Put in Mesa, AZ and get no results. Yet if you find it on the map you will see plenty. The search is the MOST important feature and it doesn’t work.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Not worth the money for me,Don’t waste your money if you prefer boondocking/dispersed camping.,2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best help,I appreciate the ability to go anywhere on the map and find information about camping or traveling.  This website is the best.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,"Great app,",It’s a must have for rvers,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great app,"Easy to use , use it for traveling to find places for overnight stay.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Got what I needed,This app is great. It has all the information you need to pick a campsite to make a informed decision.  It’s accurate. I use it coast to coast.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Junk,This app is a trick so you will buy the pro app the app is junk without the pro app literally going to cost you $40 a year,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Simply the best,"I have a bunch of them, this the one I use the most.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Favorite app,This app WAS my favorite app until the last major software change.  It was easy to see a synopsis of a park at the touch of a button.  How the information page that pops up when you select a Park is much less useful.  Previous to this last update I would rank the app 5 stars and I suggested it to every RVer I met for 6 years.  What a shame!!,3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,"Seems like a great app, but...",I want to love this app but I can't get full use out of it since the only map layer it will load is the satellite. I want to use it with the default map but all I get is a blank white grid. Icons still show up but kinda hard to determine where they actually are with no map.,2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,All Star All Stays,"I am a beginner RV’er without experience in camping.  AllStays has made the chore of finding camp grounds in areas we plan to travel much easier.  I also have a 44 ft long RV, that is 13 1/2 ft. tall.  It lets me know what camp grounds will take my RV length and let me avoid over passes that could damage our coach.  It also has pertinent information like campground phone numbers, and ratings of the campgrounds. The only drawback is, it isn’t able to be use as a trip planner, like APPLE MAPS or Google Maps.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Excellent Mapping,"Last year we traveled around Canada East and US New England.
In some removed area, we cannot find cell signal, so google map can’t work, but this map works in detail and works very accurately, amazing!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best app,Best app for RV life.  Reviews are so helpful. My go to app for sure.,5

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Very good app,"I use this app quite a bit. We are a travel softball family, and I use the map and reviews on here to find the best spot near a ball tournament as possible. It has yet to let me down!! A ton of information and solid links to the actual campground web sites. I recommend you down load it if you have not already!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,All the time,We are full timing in our RV and it’s our main go-to app!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Love this app,"We love this app, we have used others, but always come back to Allstays.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,A must have app for RV travel.,"App is great no doubt.  

Two improvements that would make make the app perfect:

1.  Map should move with your travel. Currently it lets you drive right of the edge of the map display. 

2.  Save filters.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great planning aide.,"Allstays is a great tool for planning a trip to an unfamiliar area. It’s great that it shows ALL types of campgrounds, rest stops and fuel.  It can be a bit difficult to learn to use but once you do it’s pretty invaluable.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best App EVER,"Absolutely, definitively, without question the best camping app ever made. We use it constantly; it’s accurate, informative and indispensable. Love it and can’t imagine doing without it.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,My go to RV app,This is the first place I go to start searching for a place to stay.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great Resource,"I purchased this app for planning an extended motorhome trip which we just completed. It more than paid for itself just by provided easy over night alternatives to expensive RV parks. When we had to change plans, I had all important info right at my fingertips, including repair shops, refueling places and prices, free/cheap places to stay, nice places to stay, shopping, etc. When our GPS chose to go loco, I simply followed my All Stay maps and never went wrong. My only complaint is that conditions on secondary roads aren't specified as they are on the major routes. That info lets us know which routes are best avoided in a motor-coach. I highly recommend this app.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great research and planning tool,"This app is essentially a collection of links to websites (e.g., private and public campgrounds). So, why bother buying this it when you can scour the internet for these links yourself. The reason is that all of those thousands of links are conveniently compiled in a very intuitive way making it breeze to use. I buy very few apps; this one is worth the money",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Best camping app,I use this app all the time to find camping destinations.  Filter on the app is very nice.  You can chose everything from National Parks to a gas station.  Highly recommend.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Don't update,"Updated the app and now it's slow, the search doesn't work. Was a great app now just ok. Have to do more work to find the site needed. When an app is working great, why mess with it?",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.2,Great app for traveling,We have used this app for 6 months and have found it to help where ever we are.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Simply Awesome,"I rely on this app every time we take the motor home on the road!  It hasn’t let me down yet. I love that you can access it even when no internet connection is available!  Also love the convenient links to the campground’s websites when you do have internet.  The low clearance warnings have saved me more than once, and the access to Walmart’s and other places of business is a big plus as well!  Highly recommended!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,This app is a must,We use this not only to plan but during our travels with a 43 ft 5th wheel. I used this app to plan a 5300 mile trip out west and not only did it work perfect but was accurate. So useful and resourceful. Thankful for this app.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Love it,It is the best for looking at travel destinations. It is also awesome because you can look at all the roads when you are stuck in traffic from a wreck and figure out how to get around the traffic and get on your way.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Review,Don’t like the updated version. Doesn’t show as much info and is difficult to navigate,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Bkkk,Excellent travelled USA on it never,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Extremely useful!,Love this app,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,One problem,Bee careful if you are searching away from your current location.  This app will snap back to your current location without warning. I have no idea how or why this happens.  It is very frustrating.,2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,LOVE LOVE❤️,"This app has saved my butt so many times I can’t count! Driver says, “Where’s my next diesel/pilot/rest stop, etc.” and I’m all over it! We use it on all our travels, towing or not",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great app,Great!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Don’t like the changes!,"What happened to the features where you could do a search for only what you needed to find? For example, truck stops that are RV friendly. Now you have to sort through all gas stations and everything else on the screen to find truck stops. Whom ever designed this change has NO IDEA what it’s like to drive an RV on the road!",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Outstanding RV Travel App,This App is top notch. We couldn’t plan our RV trips without it. We really like the integration with Google Maps and Waze.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,So helpful,This app has been very helpful when traveling. ..... or just dreaming of camping 😄,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great App,This is our fourth year with Allstays. Don’t leave home without it. No WiFi? - it’s still at your service. All the info you need to plan ahead or to help you today on your way.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great app for RVers,Very reliable app.  I use it for finding camp grounds and locating Walmart parking lots to sleep in.  It has always been very helpful.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Very disappointed you no longer support Android devices,Very disappointed you no longer support Android devices... after I paid for both versions.,3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Not that great.,Did not find the app any more helpful than googling.  Would not recommend.  Not worth the money.,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Old vs new version,The old version was easy to use! I could touch on state parks in a state and they all appeared on a map! Now they are listed by towns! Does not work for me!,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Trusted Travel Companion,"AllStay became my trusted go-to app while traveling across the country last spring.  I really like that it integrates many different RV park types, military, commercial, state and federal.  I would like a category for transitional parks that are converting to stick built homes, like we found in Arizona.  Also a category for parks that cater to seasonal or weekly rentals.  Some of those parks I would like to know to avoid.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,The BEST app for camping and traveling information!,"I have been using this app (the paid version) for full-time travels in my Class B camper van for several years now. It’s absolutely the most comprehensive, and most importantly ACCURATE, source of information on campsites, roadside rest areas, RV dump stations, and so much, much more! I have provided reviews, feedback, corrections, updates and additional information for many locations. Sometimes the app developer has contacted me to confirm details of my submission in order to ensure he gives his users the absolute best and most complete information. I have also tried some of the other similar popular apps. While they have some nice features that are appealing, I consistently over the past few years find their data MUCH LESS accurate, reliable or useful. I always return to this app, and consider it the “gold standard” by which to judge all the other flashy but less reliable wanna be apps. You simply won’t find a more accurate or better supported set of absolutely useful and reliable data than in this app.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,What more could you need?,Has just about everything you could ask for.  We’ll be using this app a lot.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,My favorite app.,"Use it for trip planning.  I have found all my campgrounds using the app. A must have for RVers. Pick an area, use the filter, find your next camp.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Best app ever!  Just needs some minor tweaks.,"This is my favorite app. We’re full time RVers and when you’re on the road you can follow your path in this app. Better than the map apps for that by far. You can view everything along the way including RV parks, state and national campgrounds, places to dry camp, dump stations, Walmarts, and so much more. Also shows steep grades and low clearances. I use it many times a day. LOVE IT!!  Wish I could highlight favorite campgrounds with personal notes attached. Also noticed campgrounds missing from the app but that should resolve itself in time as new ones get added. Well worth the $9.99 I paid for it!!",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,So far so good . . .,It’s nice to go to one place to find what I need!!!,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,My first go to app.,"I belong to different clubs, but I like coming here first to get an idea of the different parks in the area.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great Product,"Has improved our ability to find camping spots, plan fuel stops and LP.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great app,"Good site, easy to use",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Useful! Love it,"This is the best app for RVing or camping I have come across. We recently travelled all over the western states, using this app to determine where to stay. At one point there were four strangers in an RV park office, checking in, and ALL of us had used AllStays to find it. Our conversation would have made a great promo for the app.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Wonderful resource for van and camping materials,"This far everything we have needed to find for either camping supplies, van or chassis supplies or tire repair has been found via this app.  Outstanding!   I’m a user of Apple but sure wish this was available for the non-apple world. The latter is the o KY reason I am rating it a 4, otherwise it would be a 5.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,I don’t know what I’d do without this app!!!,We travel a lot in our Rv and I rely on this app to find almost all our campgrounds. Love it!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Key to our RV travel,We travel about 14 weeks a year in a 25’ motorhome. We go without reservations most of the time and make them just prior to arriving so that we are not locked in any particular schedule.  It isn’t perfect with all campsites but 90% are there and the rating information is very close to accurate.  We could not travel without AllStays.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Very useful app,While traveling anywhere with my camper I rely on this app all the time. It’s always right with useful information about camp site. I find the reviews are helpful also.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great app,"This app is so handy, love the filtets. Easy to use. Couldn’t ask for more.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Love the app,I use this app a lot to plan our trips. The map feature is wonderful and makes planning a breeze.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great App,"Thanks, Allstays. This app is my go to when traveling or planning a trip.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great App!,"Agree with the reviewer requesting a favorites feature. This is a great app, I use it all the time but wish I could more easily keep track of favorite places.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great site,We downloaded this app upon a recommendation from a fellow RVing friend and have no regrets. This site is extremely helpful when we’re looking for a campsite while traveling and their connected sites enable making reservations easy. Love the low clearance and store locations too. Overall a great site and we would give it a high recommendation.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Awesomeness,I use this app all the time!!!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Indispensable,5th year using this app and we consider it the most important tool we have for travel planning and on the fly decision making. I’ve tried all the others and each lacks the consistency and detail of this app. I'm hoping this app will incorporate route route planning in future releases.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great App,I use this App all the time when traveling everything works great,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,On The Road,Use it all the time. Wish you would designate RV parks that are Passport America. I find them on All Stay and then go see if they are on Passport America....(:  I also love you list all different types of parks. Thanks!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,No longer compatible with recreation.gov site. Needs update to the built in browser.,Good for finding sites but can not use to make reservations.,2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Mobilecamper,This app is my first choice when looking for campgrounds. Better than the others in my opinion.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Improvements?,"It’s a great app but recent changes are a big step backwards, as far as being able to set filters before choosing a state.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Bad choice,"We enjoyed this app until it was “upgraded” and forced its users to purchase even more in order to use any of its filters etc. I’ve already purchased the app once, I won’t be purchasing any of these “extras” they stripped us from with the first purchase. Bad business in my opinion.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Really a waste of money.,"The biggest issue is missing RV parks - lots of them. You’ll want to use this in conjunction with other tools to check out all the options for the area you are researching. A simple Google search for “rv parks near me” or specify a search for RV Parks by city or county, will always find additional parks with reviews, website links and contact information.",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great App!,We’ve been traveling around the country for the last 7 months. This app is indispensable for anyone RV’ing. It shows everything you could need while on the road.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Don’t RV without it!,Not perfect but the best RVing app we’ve ever used. We RV full time since 2015.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Fantastic App!,The only source we ever use for finding campgrounds - love it!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Way to ruin an app,"This used to be a great app, but the UI was changed in a recent revision and its usefulness is degraded.

Still the information is useful to us even though it’s no longer the standout product it once was.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,I love this app!,"I’ve been a traveling Scrub for a long time. Having an Rv is a huge help. But when it comes to finding great places and good rates, nothing beats this app for me. It’s especially helpful when I am heading to a tourist spot. I can find places off the beaten path that’s safe and quiet! When making travel plans I can use this to find gas station and places to stop for the night. Many Walmart’s no longer allow that, so it’s nice to have the info before hand.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,All stays,Our go to app. that we use on planning our trip and when in route.  We use the filter to help us locate specific needs as we travel.  Recommended to anyone who travels.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Hate the new look of the app,I used to love this app. Super intuitive to use and book sites. Now that they have updated it it’s extremely hard to navigate and very clumsy. Bring back the old look!!! 5 star before frustrating as hell now.,2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Ruined,Was a great app they change it can’t find the information I always used to find general areas. To find area I wanted to look at.,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,This is the best one there is.,We use this app daily.  We travel more than six months a year. This is the best app there is. I have tried several others and this one just works the best.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great app for planning a road trip.,Great for planning road trips. You can route from campground to campground to see how long of a drive it will be.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Confusing????,"First time RVing, very confusing to use....wished I hadn’t bought.  🥺",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Best of the Best,"I am pretty sure I have every location app for RV, camping, Boondocking etc I can say with confidence all you need is this one app. It even has BLM land. It’s unbelievable and I would gladly have paid or triple for it!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Better than ever!,"I just upgraded to the latest version. It did take just a little time to get used to it but, I assure you, it is better than ever. I van camp as a hobby and I love all of the out-of-the-way places that the app shows me that I never seen before. If you have any inkling that you might benefit from the app, just go ahead and buy it and start using it. Example- I like cheap gas and am a Costco member. The app shows me every Costco in the US with just a couple keystrokes.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Great App. A must,This is a must for any type traveler.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,Upgrade is Really a Downgrade,"I use the Allstays app religiously. It is the best site to find campgrounds around the country. Unfortunately, their new upgrade blocks access to user reviews from other sites. It also blocks the ability to post reviews on other sites. What made this app so good before was that you could read (and post) reviews on several apps, thereby giving you a wider picture of user remarks. Limiting everything to Allstays only is like throwing blinders on.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0.1,This app actually works!,"We travel for weeks at a time, and have used this several dozen times to find parks & services. Occasionally a park is missing, but that is what update functions are for. Overall, this is an indispensable tool for the traveler/camper and the absolute best of the seven or eight apps we have tried.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Trooper,"This app has been our go to source on two major trips. It has never let us down. Just got the new revised updated format. Looks to be more straight forward with respect to reviews. The icon road map is terrific!

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Our Go-to Resource for RV Travel,"Camp and RV has it all. We use C&RV constantly for finding campgrounds near our route or just places to park overnight.

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Alstays,"We just finished a five week trip from the Midwest to the west coast and back and used All stays everyday. Great information that was very accurate, we love this app!!!!!  Can't imagine traveling without it and worth every penny.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Don’t go camping without it!,"This is the best resource we have found to find camping sites!  Use it multiple times on every trip - call phone # for red, look at pictures, etc.  Great app!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Camping,"This app has been our life line to all RV parks, repair shop, where to purchase propane, RV supply,  I tell very new be about this tool.  Thanks",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Fantastic!,"Easy setup, easy to use, and beats the livin’ daylights out of that $500 plus dollar Garmin RV I bought. I may send a thank you note to the thieves who took it out of my car. It’s a positively terrific app.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Awesome app,Been using this to book all our stays! Love it!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Awesome!,Best $$ spent on an app!  Love the new update also.  So helpful finding campgrounds that will work for us.  Also the fuel info is very helpful.  Can’t say enough!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,One Great App,"This is the one every traveler must have. It has it all, easy to use, accurate and provides a amazing amount of information. Don’t leave home without it.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,I don’t understand the 5 star reviews,This app was a total waste of my money. The interface is difficult to use and doesn’t show nearly all of the campgrounds that exist. Super upset I spent ten dollars on it,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Awesome Camping Search App,"I love this app for looking for campsite.  A lot of the data is built into the app so even if you lose cell service you can still look for places close by and even still get the info on the place like GPS coordinates or phone numbers.

There is much more to this app but it is very well designed and easy to use.  I do wish something could be done able the limited zoom area size if too many things being shown.  A grouping of the items would be nice and then expands out as you zoom in.

But over all this is my primary Camping planning app.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Where is the summary?,"Why did you take the summary of the location away?  I counted on knowing how many campsites, big rig friendly, pull thrus, etc. plus knowing RV lanes in gas station. Will REALLY miss the summary.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Don’t be fooled,The reviews are old.  The app has gone down hill for awhile.  Notice there are no new reviews.  Use to love this app.  Wish it would be back to where it was.,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,A great app,I teach this app for my beginning RV class. The quantity and quality of information is the best. My students love the ease of use and what the app does to assist them with their travel planning.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,This is a great app,Been traveling in my RV this app is great.  It lets you know wat is available in the target area,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Best RV App Ever!,"A fellow RV camper suggested Allstays a few days into our vacation last month, and we are so glad he did. We used the app every single day - to find RV parks, laundromats, grocery stores, diesel gas, propane........just about anything we needed. How did we ever manage before Allstays?",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,Allstays,"This is a great app ! I use it in our RV, tent camping & motorcycling. It is very complete- lots of good & accurate information plus very easy to use. I have recommended this app to many fellow travelers & always tell camp/park hosts how I found them. It is being consistently upgraded- definitely worth the purchase price !",5

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Our go to campground finder,"My husband and I have been full timing for the past few years. Allstays has been our main campsite locator. It’s easy to use, up to date, comprehensive and accurate. The only thing that would make it better would be the ability to filter by RV size. Even without that it’s well worth the money.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,update 2018,"We love this app! New update is great!
We are retired and are full time RVers, have using this app for 3 years, best app ever!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,6.0,This app is ruined.,"This was my go-to app for campgrounds. I hadn't used it recently, but when I tried today it is basically useless. The campgrounds won't load to their website, it freezes up, and closes. I think it had a recent upgrade, and now it's ruined.  NOOOOOO!",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great for Traveling,This app is great for traveling across the States.  Love the filters to pinpoint what your needs are.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Go to app for camping,This app has saved us from having to camp at Walmart.  We use this every day when on the road.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,No reservation trip west 2018,"I love this app. We were able to travel from PA to CA and back using this app, almost exclusively, to find new sites. We stayed anywhere from 1 to 4 nights over 7 weeks of traveling with our 17 ft trailer. I did find the mileage was lower than when transferring to a map for directions. It was easy to adjust for this difference. I loved the links to the websites and reservations, as well as the links for reviews and weather. I have recommended it many times during our trip.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,My Go-To App,"We’re full-timers, and this is the app that makes it possible. I am always recommending this app to anyone who needs to know where to find good camper spots. Priceless!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great app!,My go to app for finding campgrounds along our route.  Lots of info in the database.  Filtering makes it easy to find the kind of camping you are looking for.  Direct link to park reviews.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Saved my RV and a headache,"Going to visit Zion national park.  Thought I had a route planned until I looked for a campground in the area on this app and saw low clearance issues on the route I was planning to take.   How could I have possibly turned around a 39 ft fifth wheel on the narrow hilly roads around Zion NP?

This app saved me and I didn’t even know clearances were an issue in the area!

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Very disappointed,"Promised to be comprehensive but it is so difficult to manage. And the icons on the map are SO small on my phone I can barely see them. Also often I will be in an area that Good San App says there are so many campgrounds and I look at this app and it shows nothing. Even if I click things for my filter, they aren’t there the next time I open the app. I have to check them each time. I mostly got this for the list of Walmarts that might allow you to use their parking lot with permission. Very nice on a rainy late night when I’m nowhere near a campground. It worked once. I have had the best luck with Good Sam. Sorry I wasted my $10.",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Clearances Need Updating,"This app attempts to provide information on low clearances.  I find it seriously lacking in this regard, particularly in New York and New England.   I have submitted information for updates in Washington and Oregon that we’re lacking but there are so many in the Northeast that it’s overwhelming.  I spend all my time detouring around them so that submitting suggestions is beyond me.  The app is clearly based on user-submitted input rather than legally posted limits.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Good Planning App,Good planning app but the map is not compatible with car-play and that’s a major bummer.,3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great App,This is my go to app for our RV trips. I like the customer reviews of the RV parks. Also the pictures people put in their reviews. It’s amazing the difference customer pictures vs the pictures the park posts.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Our right hand travel app,We just finished a 10k mile road trip through the USA and Canada. This app is our first stop when we’re planning our travel day. It would be a slam dunk 5 Star if it was a little more intuitive as you maneuver in it.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,The best!,"I love this app and tho’ I have other RV apps, this one is the best. I pretty much use it exclusively- I’ve been full time for 8 years and pull a 30’ tt.",5

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Love this app!,We love this app!  Gives you all the info you need to know to find a campsite.  I use it even when we are just traveling and not camping to locate restaurants and rest areas along our route.,5

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Patty T,Love this app. Use it whenever we travel.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Versatile,This app is great for finding a place to park for the night when your between destinations. Last night we stayed at a city park that had 6 RV spots in a small town in Kansas. If we didn’t have All Stays we would never known it was there.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,New to RVing. Glad I found this.,We just got an RV and I came across this app while reading blogs. We have used it only a few times but loving it so far. It is easy to use and I have found the information to be up to date.,5

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Extremely helpful,"As newbie RVers this App is fantastic!  Can really get loads of info very fast. Have used it to plan several trips and to find suitable gas stations along the way. Only thing I would love to see is some way to store or tab the campgrounds that you like or are considering for trip planning purposes. 

Great job overall!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Best RV travel app!,"Do you have the “Allstays” app? It’s the best search app I’ve found for RV travel. It not only maps every campground (with details, contact info, reviews, etc), but waste stations, truck stops and way more. It’s free, but I broke down and bought the deluxe for a few bucks. Worth it!
Whenever I travel, this is all I need to plan my stops along the way, and the longer stays too. 
Check it out 😁",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Amazing!,Just started using the app. Love it! My go to app for all my trips and planning of trips. I will be adding comments and reviews for all my stays (I would recommend you do the same this is what will add an added benefit to this app).,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Frequently used,"We use this app frequently as we travel with our RV. It is the best resource we have found for finding campgrounds and services.

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Not worth the money,"This app is NOT worth the money they charge.  
I bought it following some recommendations on YouTube, that was my first mistake. 
I use other free apps which a lot more information on campgrounds and way more reviews.
I would not recommend this app.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6,Great App on the road,"This app has saved us countless hours of worry and fret. When we feel like driving, We'd cruise along until we wanted to stop. Turn on the app, look for a nearby site, check reviews and call the best one to check availability. 
It also helps planning way ahead. Check the app long before your trip and plan out every stop along the way. You can tell so much about a campground by the reviews and their websites. It's also great for finding those little State & County Parks.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great APP for RVing!,"Easy to use!  I don’t usually buy APPs, but this was well worth the money.  Lots of helpful information for RVing. Information is up-to-date making it easy to look ahead while driving (someone else driving, of course!) for nearest truck stops and rest areas.  Love the satellite feature, so you can check accessibility for a larger rig towing a SUV.  Good for searching for RV parks before you leave too.  All around helpful APP!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,"Dated design, annoying popups","Useful campsite info, but not easy to use. Lacking offline mode. And has annoying ad popups anytime you use it to make a call.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Terrible compared to other RV apps,I absolutely hate this app and hate that I paid 9.99 for it!  There is no way to search by name of campground and no favorite button.  Definitely does not compare or come close to other apps out there that are free.,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Excellent tool for campers,"We downloaded the app and have used it to locate places to stay for over 60 nights.  The information is accurate, complete and just what we need when we are on the road.  It’s our “go to” app when we travel.  Jim and Nonie of 2McDs",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Incredible app and worth the money,"I use this app exclusively to find campsites and have done so for the last 3 years. Well worth the money. I like it so much that my wife purchased it for her phone, and I recommend to all my camping friends.",5

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Helpful and detailed,Definitely worth the money   A must have if you’re a regular camper,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great app. Best real reviews,"Maps of propane, overpass heights, dump stations, and of course campsites are super valuable.

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Filter Feature,This is a great app to use which gives you a quick geographical view of the campsites.  Even the icons let you know up front what type of campground it is which saves a great amount of time.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Not worth the money,A lot of webpage links don’t work. To look up campgrounds in the are app’s fine,2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Outstanding!,I’m new to all this and this app is excellent. All the info you need to have a successful camping experience to ANYwhere you wanna go. A great tool!,5

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Best RV app I have used,This is the best RV and camping app I have used. I use it to help me map out my next adventure. There is a wealth of knowledge to be gleaned from each and every very site. To me it is a must have app.,5

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great App,"Have used this many times.  Very satisfied. Saves time and money.  This app needs an internet connection and sometimes can be slow, but I wouldn’t travel without it.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Love This App!,"I can’t imagine traveling in our RV without this app. We spent several months every winter traveling in our RV in the southern US. My husband likes to camp by 3 pm, so about 2 pm I go onto Allstays to start looking for a place to spend one night or several nights. I just check out different campgrounds coming up, some with full services, some for boondocking. I can almost always get enough accurate information to make a decision. We’ve been using the app for about 4 years, and it works great!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Amazing App,"I have been using All Stays app for a few years now, and it’s always been top of the line. Some hiccups here and there, but they do try to keep updated and useful information on the camping spots. Being able to find so much info on campgrounds, camping stores (or ones that are great for RV’s and camping supplies and food, etc.), RV dealerships, low clearance areas, road grades, and more, all in one app is amazing. Sure some of the sites might be outdated, closed, charge more than app says (even if it says it’s free), or not exactly in right spot, but this is a great app to find what you need without searching the internet for 30 minutes figuring out what you need. (Try finding a NFS campsite on the NFS website when you have no cell service.) One addition that would be awesome is a “boondocking” section to the filter list, where people can submit a camping spot that might not be at an actual campground,  Walmart or truck stop. That would be the cherry on top for the app.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,You guys Rock,"Loving this app, great accuracy and very addictive. Keep up the good work!",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great app for camping,"We have used the app to camp from California to Alaska, it even works through Canada! Each day while we are in an area with cellphone coverage I look up the town we are going to and it shows the camp sites. Then you can scroll along the route and find campgrounds all between your destinations. 
It has also helped us find free campsites at casinos, Cabelas & Walmarts. 
This app is well worth the money to purchase!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Dmac9953,Great app with lots of info. Easy to use.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Google maps has more info,"Not worth the price, need to find a dump site, this app found 3 - google found 5 and two were closer",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Indispensable,"We used this app exclusively on a 2 month trek across the country.  We did not have a plan or reservations (before hand) anywhere, but we always found a campground to stay in thanks to this app. We stayed at a lot of 1st come 1st serve campgrounds, but we were able to make reservations on the fly through this app. Tons of useful info and links. Hint: mileage between 2 points is by the crow fly & not by roads. Use your GPS for exact mileage. I actually never use the search feature, so I can’t tell you if that’s an issue.  I just use the map to scroll then pinch & zoom. Also, buy a Rand McNally atlas & follow the green dots! Happy Trails!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,GREAT APP!,"We’ve been using this app for 3 or 4 years, and it’s been very helpful when planning a trip in areas we haven’t been before.  Even in locations that are somewhat familiar, it offers suggestions for RV service, propane etc.  I’ve recommended this app to several others because of our experience.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Leaves much to be desired-save your money!,"This app is not easy to navigate because it is not intuitive. Information about too many sites is incomplete, outdated; some positive reviews are exaggerated. It seems that a purpose of this app is to induce purchase of more of the company’s apps, which provide information that should be included in this app. I often found more useful information in a Google search, which is free. Once this app is  purchased, there is no obvious provision for canceling it for a refund. Be sure that you want it before purchasing this app. I haven’t found it to be worth the price.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Hands down best app to find great camping locations!,This is our 5th season camping in our RV and this is my GO TO app to map our journey.  Everything you need is right there in the app.  We use it to plan trips and while we are on the road.  Sometimes we want to drive 4 hours and this app will tell you all your options at that destination.  This app was well worth the nominal price for a 1 stop shop tool!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,"I like this app more than the others, but!","I use this app first before any other options but I go to Sturgis bike week and I’ve noticed 4 campgrounds missing in just a 1 mile radius of each other, 1 being the infamous Buffalo Chip, 2nd is Creekside Campground, 3rd is the Bear Butte Creek Campground, and 4th is the Ride-N-Rest Campground, and that is just in a very small area, I now wonder how many other Campgrounds are missing in the vast amount of campgrounds in this app.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Cream of the crop,"I use several resources to find campgrounds, but AllStays is my go to. The paid version of the phone app is well worth the reasonable price.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great information,"I have found this app is very helpful in finding adequate camping location with accommodation that we are looking for, (Lot size, hook ups (sewer, water, electricity amps). Campground accommodations (pool, putt-putt golf, cycle riding, pet friendly and etc.) Availability, contact information, outside resources, costs and dates. It is kept up-to-date pretty well. I am retired and use it a lot. I would highly recommend this app..",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Data is great! Interface is a disaster!,"Used it for 4 years now. 

No progress has been made with the apps flaws. Initially I thought there was SOooo much promise. 

1. Offline maps disappear randomly. The maker says this can’t be fixed. 

2. Quite a few of the campgrounds in the West don't exist and never have. Some are not where the app says they are. Several BLM and USFS campgrounds particularly the free ones have been shut down for years. I think the app proved right about 80ish % when preferring free campgrounds. 

3. The $ symbols do not reflect the layers of other permits necessary to use many state, federal and local campgrounds. This has been particularly true for Washington State. 

5. I have yet to see a review for a campground that was associated with the app. I like this option, but really wish this was a functioning part of the app.",2

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Best tool ever for planning and traveling,"This app is the best thing since sliced bread. With the many filters it’s possible find the kind of campground that suits you and to plan routes keeping you and your rig safe. 
    The bridges filter is the best! Why waste time planning a scenic route only to find out the bridge you’re approaching is 12’ but your rig is 12’-6”, with no easy way to turn around. Turn on the filters and plan your route, just that easy.
    Most of the sites listed in Allstays have hyperlinks that bring you to the reservation page of that campground. Take your time and learn the app, it’s worth the effort. 
    Between Allstays and a good quality RV GPS, I wouldn’t leave home without it.

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Best app,"Without a doubt the best camping app.  I have tried several others but none compare. Really like the ability to filter info in and out of the map, especially the low bridge warnings. You only have to get stuck on a road and have to back up once to understand the value.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,This app is extremely helpful,I had this app for years and used it infrequently for years. With it’s updates and improvements it’s now my most used and go to app for quick information on the road. Keep growing and you may become my only travel app. Great job!,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Good app,"I have had the app for about 3 months and what I have used it for was great. You can explore camp grounds, then go directly to their web site.
 I had a couple of questions contact support and was responded to in a timely matter.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Mostly fantastic app,"First and foremost, let me say that I find this app to be the best of its kind.  Extremely helpful and informative for those needing a place to sleep on the go.  I can tell that the app continues to improve and I find it to be one of my most crucial apps.  The only complaint?  UI/UX is abhorrent.  Dear Allstays, hire me to help you resolve this.  LOL...seriously, though.  Great app otherwise.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Friendly,"This is a multi purpose organization which includes a small Motel, storage facility and Laundry mat in addition to being a full hook-up RV Park. Cement pads with a majority being pull throughs. The only back-in sites are along the edge. These are also the only sites with any trees near by. No shade trees and no fire rings for the rest of the facility. Nice laundry facilities (we did not use). Small Shower house with a roll in shower for handicap use. (Did not use)
Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Our truck broke down and we needed a spot to park our TT so we could drop off the truck in another town. Even though we did not pick our trailer up until past the normal check out time the following day, they only charged for one day.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,New Roadies,"We use this app exclusively to plan our stops and to choose campgrounds or places to stay overnight.  Have been on the road for four months and haven't referred to anything else.  Love the way filters can be used to narrow down to exclude or include what and where we want.  Would like to see more reviews, but people like us are going to have to take the time to post them! We're as guilty as a lot of other people about not doing that, so perhaps a prompt in the program that asks ""Where did you stay?...How did you like it?..."" Could be 'accepted' or 'remind me later...' Or 'no thanks'.  All around, it's worth",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Not worth it,"Read all reviews though it would be good! Wrong. I can do the same thing on my google maps and I can map out my route on google maps, what you can’t do in this app. I would be going back and forth from google maps and this, then I realized they weren’t different. I didn’t need this extra map.",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great app for travelers,We like to travel without reservations. Reservations put a stress that we don’t want while traveling. This app has been a great resource while planning a trip but it has it is worth it weight in gold when you have a hiccup in your travels and you need to find a place to sleep. This app has lead me to some campgrounds I would have never found without it. Safe travels,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,I LOVE this app!!!,"This app has been amazingly helpful, especially when we go on long trips, traveling the country, and sometimes “wing it” with our next destination.  Also, extremely helpful with finding places to overnight such as a Cracker Barrel lot that is RV friendly.

The only thing that I REALLY wish this app had is a way to save favorite campgrounds to a list so that when looking up options, campgrounds of interest can easily be located again.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Totally Awesome,"We just bought our first RV, so we are newbies. This app has been so helpful. We use it all the time to plan our routes. Thank you for designing it.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great help!,I have used this app numerous times to find places to rest and stay!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,All Stays best RVing App. Ever!,"We started RVing full time 5 months ago the same time we were introduced to All Stays by Brian and Susan Taylor from The UK who were traveling via RV through the United States. 

Like the Taylors we have found All Stays to be the most inclusive research tool to plan our great adventure. 

We are grateful, and delighted to share it with others. 

Thank you All Stays for such a great product.

camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Best App in Existence,This app was one of the biggest reasons my cross country road trip was such a success. It made finding a free place to sleep each night incredibly easy and was so helpful in planning out where we wanted to be in advance. This is the best money you’ll ever spend on an app.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great App,"I have used this app for several years including trips thru Canada, Nova Scotia, and Alaska.  It has worked extremely well.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Truly a useful tool!,"This makes traveling with an RV very enjoyable. You can plan your trip, see what is available, make the reservations all on the app and more! Never leave home without it!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,amazing,Indispensable for car camping!  Got me through Washington oregon California utah Nevada Arizona Montana Wyoming Alberta and British Columbia,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Disappointed,Took our first long trip with the app. Found that my free app had more of the rv parks listed than this one that I paid $9.99 for.,2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Bad App,Bought this app and it never works properly. Only worked 1 or 2 times and hasn’t worked since even if re downloaded. Don’t waste your money.,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,New to RVing,"A friend recommended the All Stays app, I really did not want to spend money on an app that I wasn’t sure would be useful. We are out on our first 30 day trip of 3200 miles round trip and have used it every time we move! It’s great when you don’t have reservations and only want to stay one night and take off in the early morning. Wonderful app, works for us.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Absolutely worth the $10,Former full-time RV’er and now weekend warrior. This app is ha da down the best out there—whether you’re going cross country or just on day trips.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Camping & RV,Use this all the time to review camping spots,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Happy with this app.,"Great tool. Been using this site for a couple of years now. Filters make it fast to find what we are looking for.
Full time RVers, we are always using AllStays for places to stop. at.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Best App for RV’ers EVER!,"I was so happy to find this App.  No more paying for Woodall’s or any books to find Campsites.  This App has everything from Cracker Barrel’s, Rest Stops, Costco’s, Wal Mart’s and all the info that you need for each store.  Tap anything on the map and it will tell you how far you are and how to get there.
Thank you Allstays!!  You have made our RV’ing navigation so easy.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Great app,Large database of campsites with all relevant details. Great tool for planning your road trips.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Cannot save bookmarks/favorites,"Lots of information, good filters, however there is no way to save your search. You will have to save it on a piece of paper. There should be a way to save favorite places so you don’t have to store that information elsewhere. The information this app provides needs to be verified. You will still have to save locations in google maps.",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,I don’t know why this costs $10,I thought this would be a good app to get especially since it was $10 I thought it would have great information. That is not the case. If you click on the information above the campground like the images tab it just googles the campground. I can do that myself. It’s also not super user friendly. I guess I don’t know why anyone would pay for this app when Reserve America is free and you can get everything you need there including booking your camp sites?,1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Best App ever,"Use it every time we travel! Always has what I’m looking for. In 25,000miles of travel has never let me down.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Use it all the time,"Once in awhile someplace, like the BLM at Rufus, OR, won’t show up but for the most part this is the best source. Or at least the first source consulted.  It’s a great planning tool.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Terrific Customer Support,"After downloading this App I had problems the first time I updated. I emailed customer support and got an immediate response.
After swapping emails several times I was able to correct the problem and now have it working great. As a full time RVer this app is wonderful for finding campgrounds whereever we are.
This is the 2nd time I've rated this app and my opinion hasn't changed. It's great and it will be one of the 1st I download when my IPAD arrives.
After 10 years on the road in our RV this app is still the best one and the one I use all the time.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Easy navigation,"My brother in law told me about this app before we took a cross country Rv trip. So incredibly glad we used the app to navigate and find businesses, rest areas, campgrounds and such. This app is user friendly and contains much valuable information. I’ve recommended it to anyone traveling.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Trailer camping,"Been using this app 2 years.  We WANT to rely on it to be up to date and accurate, however, on many occasions it has proved to be incorrect! Not fun or economical to drive around looking for space to camp only to discover info needs updating!
Example: drove by several which said “tents” only- only to discover trailer sites were available... or vice versa.",2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,This is all you need,Best campground app available! If it could only find campgrounds with available sites...lol   ( but kind of serious),5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,need to be able to favorite locations!,"compiled informtion and campgrounds is useful but not 100% reliable, app said there were rest areas in two locations now that are not there, also when planning a trip it is incredibly frustrating to not be able to mark or favorite locations, we had to screenshot all of them or write them down, i think it could be better for the price. all reviews or images are just converted to a web search which is also annoying as it’s not very reliable i do like the app and it is very useful when looking for a dump station and in particular walmart’s which we decided to stay at most of them time as RV parks are a rip and your always crammed together over all a good app but needs improvement.",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Don’t Leave Home Without It,I have been using the program for years. If you RV or camp this program provides all the data you need to make a decision on a campground then provides a link to guide you to the campground. It’s indispensable when traveling.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.3,Indispensable App,Absolutely a must have App if you’re an RV’er. Lots of time when traveling we don’t know where we’ll be when it’s time to stop for the night. Just fire up the AllStays app and see what’s close. All the contact and directions info you need are right there. Wouldn’t leave home without it.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Easy & user friendly,This is our go to app for finding a place to stay while we travel,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Essential,This is an essential tool that every RVer should have. And - it keeps getting better!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,My goto app for camping,This is my goto app for planning my camping forays which seem to go longer and longer. I have traveled all over the west trying to get to as many National Parks as I can. The filters work very well for me.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Great,"A great, must have, app for full time rv’rs. We use it constantly when we are on the road.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Over all good app,Over all it’s a good app the search function can be a little funky sometimes. It doesn’t always return the same info or it has no return for the search. Also it can slow down become unresponsive but a close and reopen normally clears it. I use it all the time for planning not so much while driving. We don’t make to many random over nite stops so that is fine by us.,4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,OK but needs work for the price,"This app gets the job done for overnight parking. For real campground reviews I prefer Campendium, which is free. For the price, this app seems clunky and a bit dated in terms of design. It doesn’t get my resounding endorsement, but it has occasionally been a useful tool when finding a Cracker Barrel or other quick overnight spot.",3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Camp and RV app,"Good app, worth the cost!
Plan to utilize often!

Semper Fi and Seabees Can Do!",4
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Very useful,"I’ve found this app to be useful in planning my RV trips. Easy to use, the numerous filters allow for quick searches. Links nicely with Google Map. Highly recommend",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Love this App,This app has saved me a ton on travel expenses. Wouldn't go on any long road trip without it.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,All stay camp & RV,Just keeps getting better all the time. I use it all the time.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,The Riley’s from Montana,This is a must have app. If you travel our highways at all this app is for you. We use this app every day we travel. This app gets 10 stars in our book. Safe travels😊.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Bigcat,Great app use it all the time when we go RVing. Lots of info on everything from RV and campgrounds to propane and dump sites with everything in between. Can’t imagine not having it now. Highly recommended,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Great app,Helps us every trip.  Puts lots of information in one easy to use format.  Just avoiding one turn around or lousy camp ground pays for it.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Fabulous app!,This is a great addition to planning your RV trips! Very helpful!!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Great app,"Top notch, none better!
This app saved us when our iPhone map stopped working due to spotty reception. We were lost until we turned on Allstays and it knew right where we were and got us to our destination with out a hitch.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Full Timers,We full time in our 43’ motorhome and use the app almost daily to find parks. The Park ratings are accurate and very helpful. We would like to see Loves Travel Stops on your map.,3
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,My go to RV app,We full time and this is the app I use to find campgrounds and make reservations.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Cumbersome on an iPhone,So much crammed into this app except what I’m interested in: rates. Many California web sites don’t have rates up so you have to call. The app has dollar signs with more expensive ones w five dollar signs. The image button takes you to a mishmash of photos which are hard to tell if they are even from the Park. User reviews are nonexistent. Using this app we booked a park for this August only to find the town in California has the highest crime rate in the NATION. Never saw that info on this app. So maybe this app is more for the park than it is for the user. Disappointing.,2
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Saved us!,"I love this app!  On our recent two week trip to Arizona, it helped us everyday!  We were able to locate rest-stops, gas, BLM land, campgrounds all with reviews!  Worth every cent!  We’ve deleted all other camping related apps!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Worth Every Penny,This app gives campers all the tools needed for well-planned trips as well as fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants road trips.  Very pleased with this purchase.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Must Have App for RVr’s!,We have been using this app for several years now. Always accurate information and extremely user friendly! A must have if you’re are hitting the road in an RV!,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Will not search,"Same complaint as others 
$10 waste of money",1
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,This App is Awesome!,"We are semi-retired, full time RVers, traveling around the country and picking up a seasonal job occasionally. We started using this app a few days ago and filtered for free places to stay in our 23’ motor home while we are traveling. We saved more than the cost of the app on our first stay. It’s a no-brainer. Just do it!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,One of my go-to camping app tools!,"Very helpful for filtering campgrounds in an area.  I love the summary where you can get the rating, reviews, website, phone number, etc all in one visual location. I just wish for a separate, dedicated filter for casino camping!",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,Indispensable tool,For anyone with an RV or trailer. We use regularly to find camping sites both in pre-trip planning and in on the fly adjustments on the road. Comprehensive and easy to use.,5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,A great ap,"All Stays has become indispensable for our RV trips. Well thought out, works well on our phone. It has replaced the voluminous campground guides. We love it.",5
camp-rv-tents-to-rv-parks,5.6.2,The Best,This app won’t let you down.,5
smartrvroute,2.6,Awful,"The app wanted to take me hours out of my way to avoid parkways as compared to planning the trip manually which also avoided parkways. Also routed me through the woods and over a lake. 
Worse yet, I spent all day (less than 24 hours from purchase) to get a refund and, in the end, they responded “call Apple” 
I guess I lose my $9.99. So glad I didn’t purchase a bigger subscription. 
Don’t waste your time. I would have been better off with a paper map.",1
smartrvroute,2.4,Need a subscription,Would have been nice to know I needed a subscription before I downloaded it.,1
smartrvroute,2.4,Cumbersome and confusing,This app is awful! Nothing intuitive about how to simply lug your destination from the beginning! WASTE!,1
smartrvroute,2.4,Horrible.,"App does not work. It cannot locate any address I input. Case in point. I input the Web Developers address 
TeleType Co. Inc.
44 School Street
Boston, MA 02108. 
Their own app they developed cannot even locate their own address. How stupid is that? 
Contacted app support & got a very rude male who told me he could not help & insisted I text him my issue which I did last week. No response at all. I’m on a three week rv trip & spent $49.99 for a useless app. I demand a refund! Now!",1
smartrvroute,2.2,Not a free app,Is deceiving. Not a free app! You can only use the app for an hour for free.,1
smartrvroute,1.6,Not Free Not Updated for Road conditions,After entering vehicle info it took us on a route with 5 miles of DIRT road. Waited for 15 minutes for pilot car to lead us 2 miles an hour. No place to turn around to avoid it!! Why charge $50 if you can't give updated road conditions??? Piece of crap!!!,2
smartrvroute,1.6,RV GPS,"It looks like a great app.  I’m very disappointed that I didn’t get to use it because as soon as I asked it to ‘plan route’ it asked me to subscribe.  $9.99/7 days, $29.99/? mths or $49.99 yrly.",2
smartrvroute,1.6,Crap app.,I don’t know who gave this thing 5 stars. Must be a FOD (friend of the developer). Useless.,1
smartrvroute,1.6,Not Free,It’s a rip-off don’t even waste your time,1
smartrvroute,1.6,Great for RV travel,"We purchased this when RAnd McNally did away with their RV GPS app.  Was very unsure of it with the reviews I read but decided to try it.  We LOVE it!  We have been traveling for 3 months using it each travel day and it has been wonderful.  It is a very good tool for any size RV.  You put all of your RV specs into the settings (i.e. Height, weight, length) and it routes according to the best route for your rig.  You can choose, most highway, RV quickest, or RV fastest.  You can't go wrong with his app.",5
smartrvroute,1.6,Not Free,"Says it's free, but doesn't let you use the GPS without paying.",1
smartrvroute,1.6,Confusing,We have test run this but at some points very confusing.  Following the map portion is okay but when you go to the written instructions to look ahead the prior instructions are still there so you have to search the list to your current location.  I wish once you have passed locations they would drop off like they do when you use Google Maps.,2
smartrvroute,1.2,App doesn't work. Company refuses to provide refund,"Buttons do not work on IPAD.  Called company to request refund.  They acknowledged issue and provided a three day extension on subscription, promising to resolve the issue in three days.  It has now been a week; problem has not been resolved.
They have my money for an application that doesn't work on my IPAD.",1
smartrvroute,1.2,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE !!!!!!!,"Takes you through low bridges, gets you lost in downtown Manhattan. Does not suggest upper level on bridges. DO NOT BUY THIS APP!!!!!",1
smartrvroute,1.2,OK,"Still commercial truck centered.  Limited RV park info and listings, most parks don't display on map.  Not sure it's worth $50 a year to be warned of a steep hill.",3
smartrvroute,1.1,Did not work,"Installed, started and closed.  Tried twice, even changed the privacy settings.  Did not work.  I have a current iPhone and OS.  Quickest install to delete for me so far.  Oh well, the truck version did not have good reviews.",1
smartrvroute,1.1,Don't download,I downloaded this and it will not open.,1
smartrvroute,1.0,Junk,"Junk, don't do it, it set me on a route that was NOT safe for my family in our RV. This is absolutely why we were looking for a navigational app to begin with. Irritated...",1
smartrvroute,1.0,How Much #2,There is no price listed for the subscription! How much does it cost?,1
smartrvroute,1.0,How much?,"I do not see anywhere that gives a price. I know you can get this for seven days, three months, or a year. Please someone tell me what are the prices",2
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Love it,We use it every time we travel to find a place to stay on the way to our final destination. Make planners simple!,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Happy Camper,"This app is quite excellent for a free app!
It’s response to the user is quick, the information is very good, and it’s quite accurate. I use it more than any other camping app. It’s also very easy to use!
Only reason for 4 stars: I would like to see more side-road/ minor-road/ back-road detail.",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Few missing,"Let me start by saying that I absolutely love this app!  The design, the set up, the user friendliness, little icons.... With that being said the only flaw I see is it’s missing the county parks and city.  Not even sure if it’s the apps fault or the park’s fault but I wish they were on here.  Other than that I find this app not only useful but it’s my only go to when it’s camping time!",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Very useful,"Best & easiest finding both private & state parks.
I’ve use this app for past 4 years and still happy with it.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Must have app,I use this app to plan and book most if not all of my trips. The reviews are typically spot on. The map feature makes it super easy. I pick the destination and the use this app to pick the camp ground or resort. Vacationing would be so much more difficult without ParkAdvisor,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,I use this app all the time!,I use many travel apps and this one is by far the one I use the most. There is so much information state to state! I can set up my route to anywhere. It’s user friendly and loads easily. If you’re an RVer it’s a must!,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Seems like a great app,So far so good. I give it 4 stars because it’s way too easy to accidentally rate a place when just looking at it. But I like being able to check out campgrounds while planning trips.,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Good app!,Enjoying this app. A great addition would be if it showed more rv service centres.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Please don’t change it!,"Best app for traveling!  Worked better than my GPS at times on a trip across country in summer of 2019. I love it. I don’t  normally write reviews, but I did on the campgrounds, because others were so helpful.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Love this app,I don’t plan a trip anymore without this app! It’s helped on long and short trips alike.  Seeing up to date reviews on locations has been extremely helpful.  It’s also helped us find neat little stops we never would have found otherwise!,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Great RV tool,Just mapped out a trip from Indianapolis to Seattle and back (using a different route) and this was my go to planning tool.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Works Great,Use this app every time we travel.  Very helpful. Wish people would write more reviews.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,The only RV app we use,We’ve used this app for over 3 years and has served us well. While it doesn’t list everything it has worked well for us. I don’t believe you can not love this free app.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Great App,I use this app when traveling around the country. Being a full time RV’er it has been very useful.,5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Must Have App For RV Travel,Great app very user friendly informative and an excellent resource.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Good app for exploring campgrounds!,I always use this app while planning a camping trip. I love to be able to glance at a map and see how far out my camp will be from home and I like that it shows me a description of the campground itself!,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,My go to RV app,I have been using this app for years and it’s very good and easy to use. What I like best is the fact that this app has two different views map and satellite. I use the satellite view to look at the campground and the intersection for when we are traveling and also to look for fuel stops because it can be hard to get in alot of places with 40’ class A and a toad.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Love the app,Use this app all the time. Has been helpful finding sites and Alternate sites when we decide to cut a trip in half. My go to app for finding Rv sites,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Outdoorsman,"We have used this app for two years now. In the summer of 2019 we went from New York to Massachusetts then to Yellowstone and  many of the Parks of the West. We followed that up with a wonderful trip to Tennessee.
This app has been a treasure trove of information along the way!",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Really helpful,"Used traveling to Maine this past summer. Was able to find campground a couple hours ahead and make reservations, on nights we didn’t have any.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Simple and Effective,"This App is easy to use, and it meets all of our needs when planning a trip or when we are on the road and need to find info fast.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Our #1 trip planning tool,This app is where we start to plan our next RV adventure. We have found the reviews to be full of information that helps us with our decision to try a campground. We appreciate the info for Pilots and Walmart’s along the way. Several times we have greatly appreciated the warnings for height restrictions. Great app.,5

Note to developers: your stuff isn't perfect, listen to your users!",5

If the ratings were improved the app would be great. I guess I should send this comment to the developer....",3

Limited number 50 amp services. Lots of cabins used mainly during football season. No wifi or tv cable and no antenna reception found. The property manger Susan is outstanding and more than helpful however the park will be under new ownership first of Aug 2019 and Susan will no longer be manager so not sure what will be the “ new normal”.

Then you can look them up and/or call them for addresses, amenities and availability. (The url links don’t work most of the time, but it’s easy to just look up the campground after you get its name.)",5

Then read reviews and zoom in on satellite view to see if it looks decent.  I find ones that look good and plan my route.  Then I make a list of alternative sites along the way so I’m prepared if something goes wrong.  In an emergency I pull out my phone and look to see what is near by.  Once in Kansas we went to a state park that sounded nice but when we arrived we found a deserted park with one old trailer and flooded floors in the restroom.  I don’t know if the water worked because we were back in the car headed for the highway.  Pulled out the phone and found a nice little RV park about 20 miles down the road.  App paid for itself right there. Love it.,5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,This is a great App.,"Don’t normally write reviews but this app is great.  Shows all the typical campgrounds, but what I really like is the fact that it also shows all the state parks and campgrounds.  Also shows all the National campgrounds, national Forests, National recreation areas, etc. Also shows county and city parks and whether or not they have a campground there.  I’ve stayed in some nice county and city campgrounds that I never would have known about without this app.  it also tells you the distance between your current location and the one that you are looking at.  This is very helpful in planning what you are gonna do tomorrow, and the rest of your trip.",5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Meh,"Way too much data is missing to be effective

Yelp is better",3
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,My favorite RV app,"We have been on three long term RV trips and Park Advisor is not only the easiest to use but offers multiple options. I use it to find an RV Park, gas station, Sam’s Club and other places. It loads quickly and I find it easy to move across the map. Out of the 5 different apps I use, it is my favorite!",5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Best app I’ve found.,"I travel a lot, 20,000 miles or so a year. This is by far the best campground app I’ve found. The one thing it does better than most apps is state and federal Campgrounds.",5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Great APP,Very helpful info.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Easy to use,"I like the app except for a couple of things.
It blows up when I try to add an unmarked location. Don’t know why.
Would be useful to be able to save places to personal favorites list with notes.",4

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Great App,"I haven’t been disappointed yet. I use the app to find safe places when I’m traveling in my Airstream Interstate 3500 on holiday. Prices are in the $35 range, as a rule. Parks can be more rustic but mostly they are run by nice folks who keep the grass mowed & maintain facilities. Some parks don’t have restrooms or showers, just electric, water, sewer for the RV, FYI. So tent camping isn’t always desirable. My advice? Call ahead. I’ve found that more people are monthly tenants these days which equates to fewer spots for overnighters.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Really good app.,For new rv owners this app has been a great help.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Great App for road warriors,I have been traveling by rv (22’ micro Winnie) since April of this year. I don’t make plans in advance and I move every 2-3 weeks. This app has helped A LOT. I’ve recommended it to several other travelers.,5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Useful app,"Have used this app for the past 3 camping seasons.  For the most part the app is accurate and in fact we have found some unforeseen “gems”.  However,  there have been times of huge inaccuracies and had we not contacted the campground or done further investigation, we could have found ourselves in a pickle.  Have recommended the app to other campers.  Just be cautious if you have any questions/doubts regarding location",3
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.7,Great for tours,On a tour right now around the US and it’s helped tremendously! ( except when we didn’t make clearance at the Denver airport pick up lol. Only did a scratch! But solid and much needed app! I have some ideas!!! Email me,5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,The Best,I’ve been RV’ng for over 20 years and this is by far the best campground app I’ve ever used.  The campground users put out very accurate descriptions of the campgrounds.  I like the fact that I can locate campgrounds along my journey without being online.  Download it and you’ll delete all the other apps.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Best app,"I have to use several
Apps at a time to het all the info, but this one is by far the easiest to use!  Thanks everyone for the Park reviews!",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Road trip,My husband and I have been road tripping for our honeymoon. This has by far been the best camping finding app I’ve used.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Trip to Alaska,Took a trip from Delaware to Alaska!!  This app was invaluable as we looked for places to stay along the route!  Having the reviews was a big help!,5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Brian Hobart Bowdoinham Maine,Excellent app use it constantly,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Not so sure of app,"Need to prepare for trip to California, can not see any thing unless we have a name, typed RV parks, wanted city and name of park, which are of course unknown, how is this helpful when you don’t have a name or a city, why can’t it search Southern California.",1
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Very useful,Have found this app useful in helping find good places to camp,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Gem in Southern Ilinois,"We stayed here 3 nights. Beautiful setting.  Large trees, very clean facilities.  Their saltwater pool is open Memorial Day through Labor day.  We had a large pull through that was very easy to pull in.  The owners are very friendly and helpful.  While we were in the area we went over to Rend Lake golf course to play. 27 hole course.  Fairways and greens were gorgeous and the cost to play 18 was reasonable.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Best campground app I've seen,This app is really easy to use and has commercial campgrounds as well as Forest Service/National Park campgrounds. Easy mapping and contact info.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Really helpful,We used park advisor to pick out campgrounds while we were on the road for that particular evening and it was great. Lots of info that we found accurate plus mapping and such. Quite sure it would also be quite useful for advance planning .,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Helpful,"While no app out there is perfect, this app is effective in helping find cost efficient places to overnight. The low clearance notification is extremely helpful when planning a route. I love the public lands listings showing free places to stay overnight while traveling. It will remain in my inventory of go-to apps for route planning and destination searching.

Cons of this app is lack of info at several of the locations and very few images. 

Overall a very good app.  I travel for work all over the country and am a full-time camper resident. I use it often.",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Could be improved,My husband and I went out East and used several apps along the way. This app helped when we called ahead but when we tried to pull into one campground it was an apartment complex! Don’t rely too heavily on this,2
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Great App!!!!,And its free!!!!!,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Perfect App,Drove from Alaska to Tennessee and back. Used this the entire way and had no issues at all. Great bonus for planning our overnights.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,PRO version bug,I Purchased the pro version of this application. Only to later find that there is a bug that gives you an error message of “over query limit“ and when you write and ask about it you’re given instructions on how to get a refund.,1
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Great app,"Only one thing missing is the campsites that have gone private, members only.  Otherwise, the best tool in the store, especially when we’re the type of camper that plans as we drive",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,C Doty,Great app,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Must Have,"We are full time RVers and it is a valuable tool for us.  I run it on my phone as we travel so that we can find fuel stops, shopping,  and RV parks nearby.

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Great App,"Used the app on a trip from Texas to Maine towing a 5th wheel. Found the app to be the best ever to locate/select a campground. The display of Walmart, fueling locations and the clearance warnings are very helpful. It would really enhance the navigation function to show the low clearance locations on your actual selected routes. 
Planning a trip to British Columbia and am using the app now to plan my route.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Awesome App,The more I use this app the better I like it. Very helpful when traveling in my Motorcoach. Lots of helpful info on numerous campgrounds at my fingertips. Info on campgrounds so far appears accurate. Wouldn't be without it.,5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Great app.,So far I like it.,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Great app,"Just did a road trip and couldn’t have done it without this app. Very useful and a ton of great features for free. You can see how much campsites cost and what amenities they have to figure out the right campground for you. 

Only downside is that information at some sites needs updating, but for the most part it’s pretty accurate. Other user reviews helped with that though!",5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Great for traveling,"Great for finding RV resorts while traveling, I use this app a lot.",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Excellent tool for finding great sites.,This App is great for first timers and those that travel all the time. I will continue to use and bounce the site picks with other apps picks and reviews. It would be 5 stars if all users reviewed but there are only some that leave them and most only when they have a bad experience. I thank all of the people that review good or bad.,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,"Good, but a few issues","Great for locating campgrounds, but they apparently had the wrong web addresses for Illinois state parks. I had to use Reserve America.",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,5stars,App is great. Only suggestion is that it would be cool to be able to search for campgrounds with showers! Or search for the places that allow overnight parking. Sometimes it’s hard to pull over to go click on every location to see the info and all Walmart’s or stops don't allow parking overnight.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Amazing!,Traveling around US and Canada! App has saved me a few times when I didn’t have a plan for sleep. Some places aren’t perfect but the app shows you all your options even parking lots that are okay for over night parking! I highly recommend and I hope people keep reviewing the places too! Thank you,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,REVIEW,I use this app all the time.  It also includes the website for the campground if they have one so I can get all the amenities offered.  It also includes gas stations and stores nearby.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,perfect for monocycle trip,awesome for xcountry motorcycle trips :),5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Park Advisor,Great app for planning trips and traveling across the country. I did not realize how expensive some campgrounds are so showing actual costs would have been helpful. However the $$$ symbols are appreciated. I look forward to more details and photos in the future.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Great,"We used this App last summer for 3 months. It was terrific. We tend to stay in KOAs, but where there weren't any - this helped us find great places.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Almost perfect!,"All we could ask is to add the price per night as one of your competitors does, however that other app otherwise falls far short of your great features. We’ve been RVing for 8 years and like your app the best. Just wish it told us how much we can expect to pay without going to the camp website or phoning. Thanks. 
... The Graves Family",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Great app,"Best app for finding campgrounds yet, found the ones that were not found by google.  Map is downloaded and stored so even when you do t have service on your cell phone this will guide you.  That happens a lot more than you would think!",5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Made our cross country trip easy!,We took a cross country trip this summer with 3 kids under 5 (one being a newborn). We weren’t sure how far we would be able to get each day with the unpredictability of the kids so this app saved us! We were able to use it whenever we needed to find a stop for the night or a stop immediately when the kids needed a break. Also it was nice knowing beforehand which Walmart’s were available for overnight parking since they are always hit and miss. We never knew you could park at Cabelas until we saw them on this app! Great tool to save money on road trips.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Very user friendly,"New to RVing. Used it to plan our first trip to Penn State, worked great. Was able to easily identify and scout out all the camp grounds in the are. Even showed me a the local parking lots that are RV friendly for those quick 2 day trips I’ll be making.",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,RV App,"This is a wonderful app except there is no way to save a park/campground you really like to favorites. We are snowbirds and RV every summer and live to keep a list of all the places we’ve been. We share them with our RV Forum members.  This app would be amazing if we could save our favorite parks and make boards and refer back to
Them.  Thanks for the opportunity to share our opinion.",4

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Extremely Helpful,"We are relatively new to the RV experience,  but have traveled almost monthly since summer of 2017, and I use this app EVERY time we plan a road trip. This app has proven to be a keeper for locating and selecting both one night stop-overs and week long visits.  Best:  obviously easy pins show locations for camping, state parks, and RV resorts.  Worst: keeping the pins updated for locations that may no longer be available, and reviews are often sparse.",5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Very good app,"Very helpful in locating state and federal campgrounds which we love. Occasionally misses on the directions to the park. Combined with other map apps one can easily check before departure.

The campsites were awesome and the people were very nice. would recommend this site if you were going on this type of vacation or trip.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Best app for me,"Tried several others, but this is the best. I love maps and I just follow my route and check this app for the best RV places to stay. Reviews by folks who use are are pretty spot on and honest. Has some RV parks need to be updated. Shows those that are closed down too. Also shows state parks as well as Walmart, Costco, Camping Worlds, and many gas stations and several other places that are needed along the way.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Cannot leave home without it,Especially if you are ‘winging’ it with no real plan.  Reviews are good but sometime the service led ones should be purged,5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Great app,"I rode my motorcycle thru all the lower 48 States this past summer and am glad I had it. I had a small one man tent and found that most ""Campgrounds"" cost almost as much as a motel and are really RV parks is disguise.  If you are traveling on a budget and using a tent, this is a great app because it shows you were the dispersed campsites are. It is also handy for locating showers, laundry etc. at those RV campsites.

Most of the dispersed campsite were accurately marked, a few were within a quarter mile of were the app said but there were a couple I could not find. 99% of the time I was looking for the sites in the late night/early morning so there is a chance that conditions prevented me from seeing them. 2 sites I had to use a real GPS to navigate because of loss of cellphone service. This problem is not the fault of this program, but the inherent problem of the mapping apps it passes the location to.",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.6,Life Saver,Absolutely agree with several others. Great  application in a pinch and shows the military Famcamps... Use it every time we travel...,4

My job was to move that pin to the Gulf Coast of Florida to show them EXACTLY where the park is located, although this map ALSO had my location marked. Had to zoom in on the red pin & move it to the edge, then let it go & shift the map, pick it back up, etc etc etc. 
If you supply a map that can show my location, that map should also pick up the address that I just typed in.

It also includes the auto call hook up, website (when available), pictures, amenities list and directions. I used it the entire time and don't intend to delete it any time soon. It even marked the difference between state parks, KOAs, and other campgrounds clearly on the map, which made my search even easier.

It also tells you (fairly reliably) whether or not overnight parking is allowed at the Walmart or whatever that you have in mind. 
It doesn't work too well in Canada or Alaska, as many of the Walmarts and RV Parks are missing, but it works great in most of the states I've been to.

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.3,Very helpful!,I use this app every trip to locate and get information on RV campgrounds.,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.3,RV traveling,The best app for traveling retired people. I use the app the whole time I'm on the road.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.3,Fine app,"Does what it says it does. Many sites missing. Stays updated, tho.",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.3,Very Handy,Someone like me who hardly ever plans things I'm retired and I get to do whatever I want so if we don't want to keep going I just open this app which gives you the phone # and directions to the facility and with the ratings I've only had one RV park turn out to be a druggie place,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.2,Fantastic road trip app,"I rarely write reviews, but felt compelled too with this one. I've been road tripping across the country for the past three months and RV Parks has helped tremendously. Parks, beaches, parking lots, etc. this app has it all. Would definitely recommend!",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.2,Love this app,"Used this app and two others, find myself coming back to this one.  Even when using other map app, I use this one to check the others.  So now I'm just using this one.  The info is accurate and helpful.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.2,5 Stars for Now,"This app is done so well and so clean compared with so many of the other RV apps. My family and I have been full timing since May 2016 and I use this nearly everyday. From boondocking overnights to gas from stores to RV parks I've been very happy. 

Maybe I'm feeling generous or perhaps it's because it's the least worst RV app but we've got to get more reviewers (in app), pictures and MOST IMPORTANTLY the ability to favorite places. 

Keep giving AllStays a run for their money!!

P.S. Open in Waze functionality?
P.P.S. Low clearance areas?",5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.2,Not just for RVing,"Simple and Effective!
This app has been so quick and useful on a road trip - even just in your car.  Rest areas and big gas stations are highly visible and and mileages are given to the destination.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.2,Great app,This has been a good app. Use all the time.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.2,"Nice app, but ...","It seems like a really great app, but it would be even better if it would allow me to save my favorites! Why is this not a feature, it seems so simple. There's no way I can remember all of the locations that I'm interested in.",3
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.2,Thanks!,Excellent App!  Thanks for all the research and work you put into this.  Very helpful on the road!,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.3.2,Great App,We have been full time rving for about 9 months and this app has been a great help!  The interactive map is perfect for seeing what's down the road and the link to the park website is great. I only gave 4 stars because a couple of the sites web addresses are incorrect or no longer in service. I would recommend this app!!,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,I can't believe I paid for this,Not user friendly at all. Useless. Waste of time and money.,1
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Great app for campers!,"We are in the middle of a 2-week car camping trip through the Rockies and this app was invaluable! We found some great campgrounds that were NOT listed on any map or traditional campground directory. My only complaint is we found several places that looked good, only to phone up and discover they don't accept tents (RVs only).",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Excellent travel companion!,"Just got back from a VA to TX drive in my RV and it was spot on for all stops I needed or wanted to make regarding fuel, food, overnight parking, and rest areas! I especially like the low height warnings as well! Thank you!",5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,WI to CT,"We travelled from Wisconsin to Connecticut and found a place to camp each day along the way. We ""discovered"" some great camping places we never would have known about. It made it very easy to plan our spur of the moment trip.",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Happy Camper,"This app works really well. We used it to find an overnight campsite on a trip to Branson, MO. Found a place just off the highway each night on our way to & from. In planning future trips it is also a handy tool. Really like how easy it is to use.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Great app!,I love this app. It provides great information (confirm before you drive to a park--sometimes they're out of business or something). I would have given it 5 stars if I could save campgrounds to a favorites list or a wish list. I'm planning a long road trip next year and I'd like to keep track of the great campgrounds I find during the planning phase.,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Fantastic app!,Easy to use and super helpful!,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Great for dry camping and gas stops too!,"Shows rest areas, walmarts, restaurants as well as campsites. Great when traveling to new remote areas and need to know when the next gas station is or where a good turnout will be for a break.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Great app,"Wife and I full time and use this app extensively to find the next place we will be staying. Love the fact they have included Pilot, Walmarts and others. They did a fantastic job of including low bridges.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Very good,"Very good and very easy to use app. I took a star off because even though places are rated they do not have any visible reviews, you must click on the campgrounds website for that.",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Love this app,"Used this app across country, coast to coast.  It was so helpful and easy to use.  Booked most of our stays using this app.  It was nice to be able to advance to probable stay over town and see and call potential sites.",5

Would like a way to star my favorites",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Useful and great app,"We are new to RVing this summer. We would be looking at small print in a big book if it wasn't for this app. If you are taking your RV to different parts of the country, this app is a must!",5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Best Camping App!,I have tried them all!  This is by far the best around. Better then the ones I paid for. Love!,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Very useful App,"I just drove across country from California to South Carolina. Not knowing where I would be stopping each day, I relied on this App to find me a RV park with hookups nearby when I was ready to stop. I stopped 5 nights, and this app was invaluable. 

I gave four stars due to some of the directions are off, and there are some parks listed that are closed. After driving to a closed park on the second day, I called and verified directions and availability before driving to each park. 

Other than that, this app was able to find a RV park of my liking within 30 to 40 miles each time I used it. Nice App!",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Linemon,Very informative and easy to use,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Great App,Love this app. Very helpful. Doesn't show every RV campground available but close. Have been on the road almost a month without reservations at any campgrounds. Just look at this app and see what's available down the road and call ahead to see if they have a spot available. The only thing I would like to see added is campground prices.,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Superb. Get this app now. Really.,"I've never left a review before, but felt I had to for how awesome this app is. The saves so much time, so easy to use, I can't say enough good things about it. Love it!!!!",5

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Life is easier away from home!,"Love this app, it makes life definitely easier...

rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Love this app,"Made our trip much easier.  Showed how far each RV park was, what is available at the park, and reviews.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Useful tool on the road,"This app is a great tool when on the road. If you get tired, pull up the app find a campground or Walmart close by. Great for trip planning as well.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Easy to use,I can find what I'm looking for,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Love it,We love this app it helps us find campgrounds we never would have known about,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Cali-Oregon camping,Great app that found backcountry camping that didn't show on any other web search on our spontaneous trip. Found beautiful sites managed by Dept of Forestry that we would have missed otherwise.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,A Great Site for New Traverlers,I tried 3 other sites and this one truly is very easy to use and provides all campgrounds and RV sites throughout the area. Highly recommend.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Great App,"We have been looking at different web sites to find our stops on our two lane adventures, this app puts it all in one place! A bonus is the big rig friendly businesses!",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Best app maybe ever.,No adds. No pop ups. Super user friendly. Flexible & adaptable. Shows anything & everything along the road.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Best RV app,"This is the best tool we have when traveling. It tells us RV friendly gas/diesel stations, campgrounds rated by travelers (not paid for by the site), maps plus distance, etc!",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,On a road trip? Download this...,Great app. Lists pretty much anywhere you can stay overnight in a trailer or RV. Could benefit from more active users writing reviews. I try to take a photo and leave a rating for every place I stay.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Works well. Good resource.,"This is my go to app. I use others for RV park research, but usually end up back on this one.",4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Best app,"My wife and I just crossed the U.S. using this app to find rv parks, it was the easiest app to locate parks that fit our need for full hook-ups. I have a few camping and rv apps on my phone, this one was by far the best. 
I really liked the navigate feature once I found the park we wanted to stay at. This brought us directly to the park without a single issue. 
Give this app a try.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,So far so good,I haven't booked with it yet so I can't give it 100%.,4
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.1.9,Amazing!,Just finished an 8 month road trip and this app was a lifesaver on so many occasions!,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Way better then expected!,Thanks this app is great.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Great app,Have used this more than I thought I would and the info is great.  The ability to link to the camp web site is awesome.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Very Helpful!,"I use this on my iPad. Easy to use, very helpful. It's also great to add your own photos and reviews of places we have visited.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Love it,This is a great app,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Most Complete Listing But Tempermental App,"This RV campground app seems to list more than most others.  However, it is somewhat difficult to use.  The small pop-up window has links to websites and reviews, which many times don't exist.  Filtering and navigation have to be done just-so to prevent having to start from scratch.",3
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Campground app,"This is the best app around. Just type a location, enter and all campgrounds in the local area pop up. Better yet you can move the map ahead and more camps show up. I love it.",5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,Great App,We've been traveling from CA to New Orleans .. Nashville.. San Antonio and it has been great to find parks a few days and dance. I wish there was more parks listed as I have found some on Google also but this is a great way to read reviews and see pictures of the park.,5
rv-parks-campgrounds,1.2.8,A must!,We went to Sedona from San Diego And this app was awesome!!!! It is all you need for your Road trip!,5
rv-park-finder,3.5,"So simple, yet powerful trip planner","For years I used the Good Sam trip planner. I was very disappointed when it was discontinued. My sister-in-law told me about RV Parky. This years trip was centered around a festival four days travel away. I picked the campgrounds along the path. Unlike the GS planner, all campgrounds were listed. Then I filled in the dates for our festival stay and worked my way out from there. At each campground all I need do I’d put in the number of nights, the dates were filled in as I went. Easy-peazy",5
rv-park-finder,3.5,No support...,"True, this app will allow you to create a trip.  But there’s no (obvious) way to add a location / waypoint / whatever.  I have sent 2 emails asking for help and have not received any response whatsoever.  Yep, it’s free.  And it’s great if the places you want to go to and endpoints are in the database,  but if it’s not, you can’t add or find info.  
I’d love to keep using this app, but I find myself flipping between this one for routing and others for stops and such.
This would be a 5 star app if the developer would respond to questions.  I’d even be willing to pay a stipend for a “pro” version with support.",2
rv-park-finder,3.5,I’m having problems to sing up or sign in,I’m having trouble,2
rv-park-finder,3.5,Great new app for RVers.,"Really like the app and it’s interface. Will become my main app. Some improvements would help. First make the address selectable. Not all of us wish to use the default map as our travel GPS. For instance I can select & send addresses to my vehicle’s GPS. We also like many travelers keep a log and cut and paste would be appreciated. Finally, it’s been our experience that street addresses are often misleading. A set of GPS coordinates have always been more accurate.",4
rv-park-finder,3.5,"Great app, one request","I love this app and have just finished a 4 month trip. This app was a great help with planning the distance between stops, number of days to reserve and the day of the week that we will be arriving and departing.
My one request would be a way to print my entire trip when finished. It would give me info for next trip and would allow me to journal as we go and retain a copy for my records.
Please!",5
rv-park-finder,3.5,Best app for long trips,I’ve been using this app as I travel across the US.  It has been amazing!! I can’t say enough good things about how it allows you to create trips and find all kinds of places to park.  The reviews are super helpful in making decisions.,5
rv-park-finder,3.5,This is free?!  I woulda paid for this app!,"This is the go to app for extended rv travel.
It plans, edits and documents everything with simple ease. Extensive campground info, ratings and contacts included. Get it!",5
rv-park-finder,3.5,Over Rated Reviews,"I have used and relied on this application for many years to find campgrounds while traveling.  However, after posting only favorable campground reviews that immediately appeared once posted, my one negative review has yet to appear after trying twice now to post it.  That leads me to conclude that negative reviews are censored which greatly screws the information being presented.  The result? Reliance on review information is greatly diminished.  User beware:  reviews tend towards being over rated.",3
rv-park-finder,3.5,Best app for trip planning,"We used RV Parky to plan our cross country trip and it was excellent. Super easy to use. Could use more campsite reviews but that is a function of the users. Also, if the app included an integrated RV friendly GPS routing I would even pay for it.",4
rv-park-finder,3.4,Puzzled,Why are no state parks on this app?,1
rv-park-finder,3.2,The go to app for RV travel,I enjoy every part of this app. Interactive information sharing and up to date. I wish we could upload pictures to our journal entries though.,4
rv-park-finder,3.2,It’s OK. Be aware if you carry propane.,"Trip planner does not take into consideration if you are carrying propane. Nowhere in settings does it ask if you are carrying propane. We are carrying propane, and it gave us a route through a tunnel. Also, not showing any diesel fuel stations along route through RI, when there are some. Was hoping this app would show stations other than Pilot J (we use their app for their station locations), to fill in the void.",3
rv-park-finder,3.2,Not for navigation!,Enter your starting and ending destination. See a little blue line pop up but PSYCHE!!!  You cant actually use the route because It puts you on parkways with low clearances!!!  The hell man?!?!  Needs to allow for truck routes or even manually manipulate the route.  I can use it for whats near my current location and thats prob all it was intended for.,3
rv-park-finder,3.2,Great travel planner,I love this app.  It’s easy to use and very helpful for rv travel. I use the trip planner on very trip we take.,5
rv-park-finder,3.2,Is It Just Me?,"Can’t save trips, or even contact developer, without logging in.  Logging in either hangs up or results in ‘500’ error. 
Is this app still in use ?",1
rv-park-finder,3.2,Error code 503,Error code 503 when trying to log in.,1
rv-park-finder,3.2,Lost info,"Will not allow me to log in to continue my trip, gives error code 503",2
rv-park-finder,3.2,Limited State Park Listings,It’s a nice app.  Just be aware it may not show all the nearby state parks.  At least in Ohio it didn’t even with no filtering.,3
rv-park-finder,3.2,This is a 10 Star APP!,"I was on the verge of subscribing to a $19.99 a year website to search for campgrounds and plan our RV trips and then I found RV Parky for free. ❤️ I LOVE it ... Easy to use and can find ALL types of places “to park it” along our route, whether we are looking for a park with hook ups or a free ONP. Used to tediously use the map app to figure out our stopping points and then search the other apps for places to stay. No longer need ALLSTAYS for Walmart, Love’s and Flying J! The RV Parky trip planner makes it so easy to figure out our hours & milage to the next stop. My new favorite app!!!",5
rv-park-finder,3.2,Can’t delete trip stops,Really? How can I plan a trip with the app if I have to start over every time I change my mind? Can’t figure how to delete stops or edit trips.,2
rv-park-finder,3.2,Get this Not Allstays,I really like that this app is not cluttered like Allstays app. Everything you need is at your disposal. I highly recommend it and its free.,5
rv-park-finder,3.2,Took me to a scam site!!,"I looked up a campground, clicked on the button to go to the website and it took me to a “You won such and such!!” Scam website. Deleted immediately.",1
rv-park-finder,3.2,RV PARKY,Best of the best. And free.,5
rv-park-finder,3.1,Best free app out there,"I paid for Allstays and now regret it. RV Parky is so user friendly with all information up front, no extra clicking. Great for short or long trips. Quick access to reviews helped us sort thru the good bad and ugly stops along our routes. No wasting time guessing which station has what access. Thank you RV Parky!",5
rv-park-finder,3.1,Super App!,Planned 2 trips with app. Super easy and you can share it with friends. Don’t travel without it!,5
rv-park-finder,3.1,Filter doesn’t work,"Overall I like the app.  However, the filter doesn’t filter your results.  For instance, when I select 4 star rated or higher I get lower rated campsites. When I select showers as a must have amenity I get sites without showers, etc.  Fix that and I’ll raise my rating.",3
rv-park-finder,3.1,Confused,I do not find this app user friendly at all. I’m trying to plan a trip from near Buffalo NY to near Clearwater Florida. Tried create trip and entered starting city. No where to put in the final destination. No choices of routes were listed. No listing of RV parks and gas stations etc. I don’t understand this app at all. Maybe it’s me but it’s just of no use to me at all. Much better luck with Mapquest but would love to have a list of RV parks along my chosen route to Florida.,1
rv-park-finder,3.1,Love it but crashing so much...,"We have loved the app but now it’s crashing so much we can’t use it.  Select a campground and before you can review info it crashes. Every time. iPhone X, 8 or iPad Pro. Hope an update fixes it soon.",3
rv-park-finder,3.0,Best app for finding good information on campgrounds and boondocking.,"Love this app.  It is in my opinion, the best app for finding RV campgrounds and boondocking sites.  I find the app very accurate in its reviews and recommendations.  Hasn’t let me down.  
Easy to use and understand.  I frequently contribute reviews to expand the database.
The developer has always answered my emails when I’ve sent him recommendations or comments.  Commendable!",5
rv-park-finder,2.9,Vital to our travel adventures,"Used the app for the first time on a recent trip, and we will never travel without it again. We had to make a lot of last minute adjustments on a trip we had been planning for months, so I searched for an app to help find campgrounds. We were able to search and read reviews within the app. We made all of our last minute arrangements through the use of this app. The trip planning features are awesome, and I will definitely use them in the future. I love that we can save favorite campgrounds, and keep track of things like gas mileage.",5
rv-park-finder,2.9,Absolutely the Best,This app is the best support for useable information that is accurate and timely. It is easy to use and edit at need for upcoming trips.,5
rv-park-finder,2.9,Best app I have,This is a great app. Very user friendly and if you do have a problem it is addressed right away-that never happens!!,5
rv-park-finder,2.9,I want to give 5 stars,"Lots of features with this app, the only thing holding it back from be 5+ stars is the fact that I cannot figure out how to start the route. I mean figuring all these things out, the route, the stops, the mileage, and it doesn’t give turn by turn directions? Or partner with another app like wazes?",3
rv-park-finder,2.9,Love this ap,This ap is wonderful I found sites here that wasn’t on google maps or good sam,5
rv-park-finder,2.9,Hate the update,I was a lover until the update. Update is glitchy. Won’t zero in on my current location and having to hit search when you move the map is terribly annoying.,2
rv-park-finder,2.9,What have you done???,"Where are the campground maps? Where is the ability to see what is available and when, by date? You only give a phone number to call. That is a poor substitute!!!",1
rv-park-finder,2.9,Change is not always good!,"We just finished a cross country trip and used RVParky most of the time, but this NEW format is impossible to navigate!  The map to see where these parks are, the ease of checking availability, just not easy like it used to be.",2
rv-park-finder,2.9,Sharpest tool in the shed!,Planning our 9 month trip I used 3 apps suggested by others. RVParky was by far my go to. It’s easy to use and 98% of the parks are there with many reviews as compared to the other apps. My only ask would be to include max length for state/national parks.,5
rv-park-finder,2.8,Was good but lost something.,I’ve been using this app for a while however this newest update lost the simplistic feature of clicking on a map and highlighting a campground and telling me all about the campground. I hope it gets fixed soon. I can see there is a spot but I can’t click on it anymore. It just doesn’t nothing.,2
rv-park-finder,2.8,Last update fail,Updated and now the icons only enlarge a bit and doesn’t bring up any information.,1
rv-park-finder,2.7,Used for 15 day trip with great success!,"We took a 15 day trip from SanAntonio to Buffalo, NY and back with no reservations.   Used RV Parky each day to find a campground.   Very accurate in info and locations - not to mention it was sort of fun ""living on the edge"" not knowing where we would end up each night.

Update.   The newest version stinks.   No longer intuitive.  Very cumbersome.   Too bad, they had it nailed with the simple version.   Glad I have not updated on all of my devices as I can still access the good version.",2
rv-park-finder,2.7,New app for me.,Seems to be easy to us pretty through. The best out there now. A lot of forethought when it was made. Thanks,5
rv-park-finder,2.7,Amazing!  Best App Ever,Really believe this is the best app ever for RV’ers and campers. We use the app all the time as we wander in our camper. Deserves 10 stars.,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Great App,This app is easy to use and works great to find what your looking for. Just serch and go!,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Good app,Great app right on time,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Excellent RV park finder,"This is really a great app.   lots of great information about private parks plus state and federal campgrounds.   another great feature is little caution triangle To warn and tell you low bridges.  a very very good app for motorhomes and travel trailers. All the information is at your fingertips, the amenities, websites of campgrounds, lots of information including Walmarts.  A must have app and it’s free",5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Prices,Prices with this app seriously out of date.... prices tend to be as much as twice as much which tends to make me believe there are many more errors,1
rv-park-finder,2.6,My 'go to',I find this site has dependable information.Much needed as my husband and I take on the challenge of RV travel.,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Love this app,As novice campers my wife and I used your app for our first outing. Took us to a great CG and we had a great experience.  Will definitely use it again..,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Great app,Really like this app for finding RV Parks. Very easy and the map mode is great.,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Great App for planning a trip,"There are many features with this App that help you plan a trip, like Walmart, Fueling location that Friendly for RV's and many other places along the way.

rv-park-finder,2.6,THE go to app!,👍🏻😃🎶🇺🇸🥁☕️,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Great app!,But unable to leave reviews at locations I've stayed at for some reason,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Love this APP!,Just planned our trip using this APP for the first time! Love to be able to read reviews of real campers and see everything available in the area....even just truck stops if just needing a place to stay for the night. How much fun and informative planning this trip has been thanks to the APP!,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Not 100% correct,"It’s a decent app but NOT always correct information, it list some areas as not being able to stay overnight and when we called the location they told us it was fine. Always call to check, you can’t rely on this app.",3
rv-park-finder,2.6,Old camper,A great site for finding the best camping spot!,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Incredibly Handy,I've used this app for a month and love it! Both the map mode and list mode are very helpful.,5

rv-park-finder,2.6,Excellent,We became full time RV'ers earlier in 2017.  We've used this app over and over again.    We had a few issues with WalMarts that may or may not allow you to stay overnight.  It's all about due diligence and everyone taking the time to update the app,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,I love RV Parky,"I have been using this App for a fe years, even in Canada!   The only negative is not the fault of the App. Occasionally someone will post a park review without giving any specifics .   That is not helpful!  This is a must for travelers!   Excellent! For planning I recommend roadtripper but on a full size screen.",5
rv-park-finder,2.6,RVPARKY,Works well for me so far. I've found suitable sites from Florida to Northern Minnesota.,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,My favorite CG app!,"We travel all year for work, and have been for 3 years.  This app beats ANY other CG apps, even the ones I have memberships with. It gives you the nearest CG in your area, or wherever you are going. Plus, it gives the CG  website, phone # , reviews, and what amenities they have. It's frequently updated and has not let me down yet. It also lets you do your own filters for the CG that fits best for you.",5
rv-park-finder,2.6,Great tool,Full time RVer. This is my primary tool to find campgrounds and Walmart.  At times even truck stops. Love it,5
rv-park-finder,2.6,useful tool,we use it for our annual treks across the country and  find it very helpful. only comment i would make is they need more reviewers as many reviews are dated.,4
rv-park-finder,2.6,App for iPhone not intuitive and sometimes useless rating,"Have used the RV Parky android app for 3 plus years with my Samsung smartphone and it was fantastic. Last year switched to an iPhone using same RV Parky app, but there's a real drop in quality in how the app functions.  It's not nearly as intuitive with search and wording used, that is, it's functions are much slower and app is constantly searching and pausing. Otherwise, the RV Parky app is a good collection of sites and ratings; although needs better input from users and occasionally misses the mark in description, phone numbers, closings, or isn't even aware of some good RV parks that exist, but can find them on Google or Allstays. Site users who do the rating of these parks sometimes just want to vent about insignificant dribble, therefore should have means within site for feedback of that users useless rating.",3

rv-park-finder,2.5,Great App!,Excellent information in a easy to use app. A quick snapshot of what's available and the resources to dig further. But it's only as good as the users make it. Review the parks you use so others have an up to date review.,5

rv-park-finder,2.5,Awesome,"This app was used from the west coast to the east coast and back west again, a six week, 9,000 mile RV trip.  For a couple who are recently retired and beginner RV'ers, this app was a god send.  It never lets us down and is the only app we use when we hit the road.",5
rv-park-finder,2.5,Dependable!,"RV Parky is one of the two sources that we use to select parks. We have been on the road for 2 years and if a park is not good with the reviewers, we don't stay.  Very dependable and easy to use.",5

rv-park-finder,2.5,Easy Peasy!,"Extremely user-friendly and gives you all the information you want and need when planning your trip. I've used it for planning a multi-state two week vacation that was planned from home base months in advance, and most recently on a cross-country no-plan trip where we didn't decide where we would stay until we got tired of driving. RVParky worked perfectly in both. Great filters to show only the parks with the amenities you just can't live without. HUGE time-saver!!",5
rv-park-finder,2.5,757,Good so far. I have booked 2 trips through app.,5
rv-park-finder,2.5,Great tool for RV traveling,Take time to get used to the features and this little app is great for the RVer. It does where u are and the exits/areas of interest on a map or list. I'm visual so I prevent the map. Good travels and God speed.,5
rv-park-finder,2.5,Works for me,"New to app. Learned all filters must be unchecked for everything to appear (e.g. Public, KOA). If any filter is invoked only that will appear.",5
rv-park-finder,2.5,Easiest RV App,I have several RV apps but I like this one the best.  It is easy to use and it remembers my filters. The map is very useful in helping us pick our stops along our route.,5
rv-park-finder,2.5,recent versions less useful,"This was my go-to app- I updated and now many camping areas such as State and NFS campgrounds do not show- only commerial campgrounds.

rv-park-finder,2.4,Great first step,"Has the parks and sorted by map, list and terrain..all RV park listings seem to have a direct link to park website so easy access to telephone number and availability grids if listed.",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Needs updating,Seriously needs regularly updating and revamping of the park review system. Many of the Washington and Oregon State listings contain RV parks that are closer to trailer parks and/or homeless encampment for folks with older barely running motorhomes,3
rv-park-finder,2.4,Goto app,RV park he is the app that I go to first out of the five RV apps that are on my phone. It is simple and straightforward. I really appreciate the reviews from other RVers to find  quieter spots to park while traveling the interstate I'm gonna make an effort to leave our own reviews from this day forward,5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Top notch!,"I have been full-time RVing for four years this is my go to app of all. It's like my Bible.

rv-park-finder,2.4,Works OK,This app is just as good as the other RV apps out there,3
rv-park-finder,2.4,Great App,"Great app for newbes!  Has been very helpful.

My full-timer brother-in-law turned me onto this app.  We used to do a 10,000 mile cross-country trip. Can't say enough good about it!",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Very Helpful,The app shows campgrounds other apps don't. It doesn't necessarily mean those campgrounds are better just a lot closer to where I need to be. This app has saved me hours of driving time.,5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Missing campgrounds and bad pricing,"Seems like a good app but it is missing way to many rv campgrounds I found one in Lafayette Illinois that I found on another app verified off google and I even called them but missing off this off,plus the pricing is off and that can really hurt when you are traveling with certain amount of money.But the app is free so I guess what you don't pay for.normally I am all for free apps and a lot been good but this one I am very disappointed in.",1
rv-park-finder,2.4,Helpful during our trip out west,"We used this app for our monthlong trip thru the western mountain states.  We found it helpful while searching for last minute RV locations since we were not on a set schedule. Also, this app shows Walmart locations which are always important for quick overnight stops.   Great app.",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Invaluable for RV Road-Trippers!,"Can't beat this app for its at-your-fingertips info and easy to grasp visuals. It's a great resource both before, during, and even after your trip to plan the next one!",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Love this app,Way better than Good SAMs app,5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Super App!,"I live on the west coast and last year I flew to Cleveland to buy used MH.  I took a 5000 mile route home and used RV Parky as my Go To App.  I have a couple of others I like, but not as well.  Nice to have more then one to get the maximum options possible though.  We were never unhappy with any parks and frequently ecstatic.",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Rvparky,"This app is not helpful at all. It never finds parks near you and defaults to California and I'm 3000 miles away from there. If you type in a specific campground, it cannot find it. It's free for a reason and it's terrible. Don't bother with it.",1
rv-park-finder,2.4,Filters,"Nice app. Would be nice if there were just a little more filters. For example, we like bringing our golf cart and or motorcycle. However, there are campgrounds that don't allow either. It would be nice to filter this.",4
rv-park-finder,2.4,Great App. 10 STARS!!!,"Used this while on a two month 6,500 mile tour through 15 states. Stayed at a lot of out of the way places you wouldn't know existed with out this app. My wife couldn't understand the ""RVparks"" app I had originally started with. She found this one and we both love it. 
VERY USER FRIENDLY!!!
I love that it shows the Walmart stores too!",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Cross-country,Great app! Worked like a dream as we drove through our tour of the Western states. We knew what was there and we literally were able to book on the fly as we pulled into a town or park.👍,5

rv-park-finder,2.4,Good App,I love it!,4
rv-park-finder,2.4,Go to RV park app,"I use other apps to look for RV campgrounds, but I always come back to RV Parky. It is easy to use and has good information. It isn't as complete as I would like sometimes, but for the most part, it is my favorite.",5

rv-park-finder,2.4,Best way to locate RV parks,We've used this app to to find RV parks and read reviews to decide which one we'll stay when traveling through,5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Great app,Makes it easy to find a campground along the route!,5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Love this app,Used it across several states. So easy to use my kid found our sites while I drove.,5
rv-park-finder,2.4,4* Good but doesn't work offline,"This is my goto RV park finder app and I really like it but it has failed me when I'm out of cell phone data range and there is no wifi available.  May I suggest to the developer that they include a function to download data within 100, 250, or 500 miles of a selected location? That way the user can download park data for the next night if needed and they have a wifi connection.",4
rv-park-finder,2.4,Indispensable Travel Resource!,"I don't know how anyone can travel in unknown areas without this app!!  Although I have Triple A and always go there for a TripTik, neither the maps nor the Woodall's Campground Guides show all of the available campgrounds.  This app doesn't show all of them either; however, the app has many more to choose from.  In addition, you can read reviews, get rates, and link to the campground websites right from the app.  Wonderful!!!",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,TR,"Cool site,but most of the reviews are old or very few making the rating higher..",3

We started using this app about four years ago and it gets better with each update. There are several apps out there that do several things such as RV dumps, military sites, etc. this site does it all and better. You will not be disappointed.",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Great,This app helped us to find good RV spots on our recent cross country trip. Hopefully as it gets more popular it will have more reviews for individual locations.,5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Very Helpful,This app is super helpful in finding a place to camp. I highly recommend it and am very grateful for it. The only issue I have with it is the prices it lists are never right. Pretty much need to add $10-$20 to price listed.,4
rv-park-finder,2.4,Awesome,This is a great app for camping and travel,5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Very good resource,"I have found this app to be very helpful.  It does what you need it to do, and then some. Filters are helpful to provide the information you need. Definitely recommend this app.",5

Very useful!",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,"If you live in an RV, you need this.","Unbeatable app for serious RV people. Gives you all the options, unlike other apps.
The one single improvement I can think of, is being able to list sites by price.

rv-park-finder,2.4,Horrible app outdated,"Using this app across the south was very frustrating. 2 parks we drove to were closed and we were told, over a year ago. Other parks we found by accident were not even listed on the app. The info here is OUTDATED and not at all helpful!",1
rv-park-finder,2.4,Great App for a hit the road non-planner!,"We use this app all the time while road tripping! We even use it while traveling in the car on day trips. On this app you wont just find campgrounds nearby but walmarts, travel centers, gas stations and cracker barrels. Its just a really simple helpful app when you're on the road and haven't researched and planned every detail of your trip-like us-we tend to be adventurous and just GO! :D",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Reliable,Very handy to have. Good info such as phone numbers to call ahead and verify.,4
rv-park-finder,2.4,GREAT EASY TO USE TOOL,"Being new to RVing we were looking for a easy to use tool to locate campgrounds and have found RV PARKY to be just that tool. Not only does it locate them but also lets you go to their web site directly if they have one. The only thing I would like to see is more information on US DOI, and state campgrounds besides that it is super easy to use with great information. Highly recommend it! Update to this review. We now have been using RVPARKY for two years and have found it to be our go to for locating parks and information on them plus there have been many new parks added in the last year making it even better.",5

rv-park-finder,2.4,Great information,"As a camper that often knows where I want to be for a general area, this APP works! When traveling just decide a city or town you want to be explore and type it in. You get options for a new base camp location, amenities list and often pictures so you can decide. Costs are usually pretty close but there have been fluctuations.",5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Very Helpfull,Very helpful if your looking for places to go out side of your neighborhood.,4
rv-park-finder,2.4,Great First Step In Finding RV Parks,"I have developed a workflow as we travel cross-country in finding good RV Parks in sometimes out of the way places. RV Parky is my first stop. I haven't had any issue with setting most filters that are important for us. From the parks that have decent ratings that are fairly recent, I next check the park's website, and lastly use another one or two sources to see if reviews seem consistent. By then I rank the top two or three based on our criteria and price, and make the calls. And do this all in the coach while my husband drives!  Great app - and so far, we have made pretty good decisions with our eyes open. And yes, I post my reviews, too, to add to the community.",5

rv-park-finder,2.4,Best Option Out There!,"I tried tons of apps searching for a parking spot for my Tiny House. This is definitely the best one, most extensive database, more amenities to filter than other apps.

rv-park-finder,2.4,Luv this app,We camp a lot so love this app and reading reviews. Have been to some great campgrounds based on reviews here and have avoided some dumps.,5
rv-park-finder,2.4,Filters don't work,Trying to filter based on which locations have 50a electric service however the filters appear to do absolutely nothing.  Otherwise nice app,3

rv-park-finder,2.4,"A bit clunky, but servicable.","More refinement can be gotten once you find the site.  It isn't necessary to add another layer of review through this app.  If you wish a community of reviewers, keep it current.

rv-park-finder,2.4,Very useful,Really nice map and easy to manipulate. It makes traveling and finding places to stay much easier,4
rv-park-finder,2.4,Best RV app while traveling,"This is my #1 app to go to on the road for locating fuel stops, rest stops, Walmarts, and  of course Cracker Barrels.  It's the quickest too. Just hit the search near me button and bingo!  Helps to locate dump stations because we boondock a lot.",5

rv-park-finder,2.4,First time user,RV Parky is awesome.  We traveled from Florida to Las Vegas and this site was so very helpful.  The Walmart sites that let us know if overnight staying is allowed was especially useful.,5
rv-park-finder,2.4,First timers,We are first time RV travelers and didn't really know where we would be staying in our 4000 mile journey. RVparky was invaluable in locating options in small out of the way places along our way. Only had one RV park that we drove into and back out of in our 10 night trip. I recommend this app!,5

rv-park-finder,2.3,Best Rv App Yet,"This app has a lot going for it. The map search and filters really make it stand out. The reviews are great, yet it would be nice to see them pair up with another web review site and tie it all together. It's a great option to search for web reviews. Get those tied into the app, and this is a 5 star app!",4
rv-park-finder,2.3,Good App,Although there are not enough reviews or photos. But outside of that and it's a great tool for any camper',4
rv-park-finder,2.3,Helpful app,I like this app because it shows me RV locations that do not appear on other camping apps. It really came in handy tonight when all the other camp grounds were full.,4

rv-park-finder,2.0,Excellent so far!,"I've looking for an alternative to AllStays Camp & RV because frankly it's too expensive to keep on our multiple devices.  I like to do my trip plans using my iPad but on the road I prefer to use my phone.  With AllStays I had to buy 2 copies at $9.99 each.  Ouch!

I've been comparing this app side by side with AllStays while planning our next trip.  RVParky can find more of the small towns I've been researching than the AllStays app and the ability to set favorites is a big plus.  The real proof will be when we take it on the road next month.  I'm concerned what will happen when we're out of cellular range.",5

Highly recommended!!!",5

campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.2.0,Need more resources,"I think this is an excellent source for camp sites and dumps. However, not everyone is in a park with laundry or propane. It would be really great if laundry and propane sources could be found on here. I am currently at a laundromat, for the second time, in southeast Tucson that is the best I have been to and very conveniently located right off a main highway. 

Could you allow users to add these sites?",5

campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.1.2,Cotati Park & Ride,"Before staying here for 1 night, I had called campgrounds & RV parks in the area. Local KOA was $89 w/hookups & still high for dry camping. I’m in a Skoolie. In Sonoma-Casinos will not let you park either unless you gamble & then not overnight. I’m from California but I can only say how uninviting this state is to travelers compared to other west coast locations. I found the park & ride to be just fine (yeah & the rooster does start crowing in the early morning hours 😱) Traffic noise but it diminishes after midnight. No other overnighters here but also no knocks on the door. Recommend for the weary w/ nowhere to go & it’s late. 👍😎🚌",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.1.0,Our #1 camping resource for over 4 years.,Campendium rarely steers us wrong (when it does its the because of an individual review rather than Campendium). There's definitely an art to interpreting reviews and after a while it becomes second nature to examine each reviewers equipment and get a sense of their priorities. Support has been very responsive and helpful. I love the fact that it's become a like-minded community.,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.1.0,Not for me,Downloaded the app to see if it would be beneficial in my area. There was nothing within 25 miles for me. I tried to expand the search radius but it kept prompting me to login or signup for an app that might not even be helpful for me. It was very frustrating.,1
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.3,"Quiet, safe place","This is a quiet, safe place to stop. You need to check in with security when you arrive. Parking for RVers that want to spend the night is near the back of the parking lot, on the concrete area.",4

campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.3,Perfect app for wanderers,I’ve been using this app for over a year now and it has brought me to some of the most beautiful campgrounds. I’m a big penny pincher so the fact that you can search for free or cheap sites is my favorite part. You’re able to read others reviews and browse pictures before heading to the site. It even links your map apps to the gps coordinates ensuring you can get there stress (and paper map) free. I’ve recommended this app to all my fellow traveling friends. Thanks Campendium for helping me find some hidden treasures!,5

campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.3,Relaxing near the water,Beautiful clean campsites,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.3,Where to begin,"If you like camping, or road trips, or even know what BLM land is, you need to have this. It’s that simple! Kind of want to camp out at what looks like a good enough spot to stop the RV on google earth? There’s probably pictures of it already on Campendium, along with whether it has cell coverage or not, and from which providers. And someone will likely have left a review saying which sizes of RVs could safely turn around down that other road you were looking at. Then take that location, open it in Apple or Google Maps or copy the GPS coordinates for further planning. 

My favorite anecdotes from the last year of using it all boil down to “a few reviews warned how bad this six miles of washboard road are, which would have deterred us otherwise, but they said it was worth it so we kept going and it WAS; or not knowing where to stay in an area and finding some unmarked hollow on the side of a mountain, unbelievably scenic but shockingly close to town. There’s so much out there other adventurous folks like you will help you find!

Get Campendium, go outside, and stay there.",5

campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.3,Final stop on a 3k mile road trip,"We had been on the road for 18 days and have traveled through 8 states and were looking for a great place to cap off our amazing trip before we headed for home in the Bay Area. The drive was from Portland to crescent city. We booked the day of after we had already arrived in town around 4pm and grabbed some dinner. We had kinda lucked out as there was only 1 spot left for full hookups. The lady answering the phone was super nice and said they only had a 50 amp spot left and I’d need to get An adapter for my 30 amp cord. I picked one up for $20 and headed to the RV Park. This place is beautiful. It’s planted in a heavily wooded redwood tree grove and most spots are separated pretty decently so it’s almost like you have your own little forest. My spot #80 was a little tricky to back into with my 16 foot travel trailer because it sat at an angle but was able to get it into place with out too much maneuvering. Went to hook up and the site had a 50 amp and a standard 110 GFCI outlet ( Which I already had an adapter for) so I didn’t need to pick up a 50-30 adapter but not a problem cus it’s good to have anyhow. Anyhow the check in was nice each campsite has its own fire ring. The main reason we came here was because it seemed kid friendly and it didn’t disappoint. There were. Bunch of kids and lots of activities near the office including a nice playground. My daughter had a great time with the other kids. The only downside was I wasn’t able to use the WiFi in my trailer which isn’t the worst thing but would have been nice to relax after such a long trip and watch a movie or something. Anyhow we paid 62 dollars for the night with full hookups, with cable, a bit steep but worth it if you get a good site. Ours was super quiet despite being close to the 101 freeway. There is a cool walking trail as well onsite so be sure to check that out on the west end of the park. The office person did warn me of potential break ins and theft around crescent city so be sure tuck belonging away just to be safe but we had no issue. They sell firewood and if I heard correctly it was 16 dollars for a bundle so bring your own if that’s the case haha. All and all I would stay here again if I came through the area and would recommend it if you don’t mind paying a little extra for a beautiful campground, as some of the others in the area were not remotely as nice as this one.",4

campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Nifty feature - map link,"Just downloaded the app and immediately can tell this is a keeper. Easy and intuitive, actual user reviews, photos, etc. One nifty feature i noticed is the option to “show in maps”, which then gave me the option to use google maps (or other map apps if you prefer them). Sweet. No flipping back and forth trying to view the campground in satellite or street view, or messing with a map app you’re not familiar with. Very handy! 5 stars just for that haha. Seems to be an app made by campers for campers.",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Great app- but incomplete,"Great app with a great filter system, and good feedback from other campers complete with dates, site numbers, and cell reception. Used mostly this for a cross country motorcycle camping trip.

campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Excellent Tool For Campers,"Campendium is an exceptional resource for campers!  It is the single best source of user reviews of public and private campgrounds and their associated amenities.

The mobile app is clean and and intuitive making it easy to both write your own reviews of campsites and read reviews written by others.  The interface makes it simple to upload photos of your campsite directly from your mobile device.

I personally use this app in conjunction with the new recreation.gov app to plan all my camping trips and make reservations for those high-demand campsites on federal lands.

campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Great place and very friendly staff,"The family and I pulled in late night and just chose a spot to rest for the night. The staff was very welcoming the next morning. I ended up booking for one more night just because of the staff and the beautiful seclusion of the park.  We stayed in spot 14 which is set back in the park and right next to the creek which kept the kiddos busy for hours.  This place is about 8 miles down a graveled and dirt road, but definitely worth the 20 minute drive. We would definitely stay if we ever visit again.",5

campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Smithsonian Butte,"Zion park was a zoo on March 30th 2019 and all parks were full due to spring break. We hadn’t really figured we’d stay and are always giving our free spots first option and boy I’m glad we did. This Butte was like your own Zion experience with zero people at the very top and along a side road which boarders a canyon and breath taking views. We were in our 4x4 sprinter revel and needed every bit of it to master the tight corners, rocks and dips it needed to navigate. Definitely no big rigs past the first set of turnouts. Shared the top with a few mountain bikers but never saw them much. Could have stayed forever!!",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Can’t add places in APP. Also can not update places in app,Great idea but would be better if the app was more user friendly. Everything must be done on website. App needs more capabilities!,2
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Quiet & Cute,"The owners were super nice, found a spot for us, there a some residents here but they all seemed quite and kept to themselves, they offered a fire pit, little pricey at $30 for the night but was all around good",4
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Best kept secret of the southern tip of the Sierras,"This is our 2d trip to Red Rock, having stumbled onto this little gem a few years ago on our way to Death Valley. Last time the place was empty on arrival. This time, we arrived at 6p and freaked because the campground was nearly full. We had broken our “get to campground by 1” rule, so I gave hubby the stink eye and tried to blame him. Then, magic. Our favorite spot - #50 - was still vacant! Waiting for us. Ok, it was one of the most unlevel spots in the campground, but who cares? That’s what levelers are for, right? Gorgeous sunset, and now spectacular pink sunrise. Warm during the day, freakin cold at night. They now have free WIFI! So hubby was pretty happy that he could still work (and watch Netflix). The trail right near #50 did not have a “no dogs” sign, so as soon as I finish writing this I’m outta here with Sofie & Tyler!",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Please fix the $ rating system!,"I love this app- I’ve used it almost exclusively to find places to camp while on a year-long camping trip. The only thing I wish they would fix is the $ symbols used to reflect how expensive sites are. You will see a campsite for $20 rated as $$$, then an RV park in a nearby area for $41 rated as $$. Fixing this confusing system would make it a legit 5 star!",4
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Charles town Hollywood casino,We were here in March 2019. On our way yo New England. Large parking lot plenty of space. Open24 hrs and fairly quiet. Went in for food and drink and to play. Horse racing happens Wednesday thru Saturday so we missed it. Nice facility.,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,The Best!,"This is the best camping spot finder I have found. Even better than All Stays. I use both, but prefer and enjoy Campendium. Very helpful, informative, and really user friendly.",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,RV parks aren’t camping,This app is heavy on RV parking and little about free tent camping.,1
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Not impressed,Who wants to log in or sign up to use a mediocre app?  Not me.,1
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.2,Nicest RV park in the area.,"RV park is located in Del Mar on the fair grounds.
The RV manager Juan is extremely easy to get a hold of (619-240-0736)

You can park any signs of RV or age.",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0.1,Constellation Park is a great spot!,"Know nothing about the area around Wickenburg, we turned to Campendium to find a spot to spend the night on our way to Tucson. Other area campgrounds were full for the night; even so, we look for opportunities to boondock. The dirt road in was easy to navigate in our 28’ Airstream and we found a nice spot that was nearly level. The lights from the town are pretty at night, and if it wasn’t so unseasonably cold (and then rained off and on most of the night) we would have really enjoyed sitting outside and enjoying the quiet, the view, and the stars. It was easy driving out in the morning even though the ground was very wet from rain. It’s a great deal for $8!",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,2.0,"No, you don’t need or get my email address","I have no idea why a camping directory needs me to surrender my private email address just to show me information on a nearby campground. And I guess I’ll never find out, because I deleted the app for not respecting my privacy.",1
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Add to drop down filter,Add dog friendly filter,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,App down?,"You have my $.   Now I look forward to you fixing the app so I can use it.

campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Helpful app,Use his app regularly to find camping sites. Park reviews have been very accurate,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Couldn’t go camping across the country without this app!,Amazing and free!!,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Unusable,The app is amazing but it makes me sign up and when I do it errors out every time and dosnt let me use the email again but the account won’t work so I can’t use it,1
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Great app for anyone.,"It’s so easy to use and free. They have ya sign up but it’s was fast and easy. It locates great areas, doesn’t crash and always pin points me. If it doesn’t pick you up and you can’t find yourself on the map maybe you shouldn’t be looking to camp in rural sites. Excellent tool. Hopefully those who use this don’t abuse the areas it’s helping you visit. Great job!",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,"Nice views, friendly staff",The campgrounds are immaculate. The Facilities are a little dated but clean and the staff is really nice. There’s no charge for the showers And there’s a laundry facility. Bring quarters for that. There’s a huge lawn area and a play area if you have kids.  The pull in spots seem to be pretty long and spacious. However I’m judging that on our pick up truck and our little Casita trailer. LOL everything seems big to me!,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Campendium is super helpful,While traveling I use campendium to find blm/public lands and dry camping style places! I am impressed with the app so far. Five stars.,5

campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,John day Dam Park,"Great place if you want solitude, great views of barges and birds, and a unique setting.",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Great job,It’s about time for a modern campground app. Great job.,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Juniper campground,Great place.. wonderful facilities clean and well taken care of.. the camp host was really a big help with answering any questions you may have.. the only drawback was no lights in the handicapped shower and bathroom. No access for fishing unless you have a boat.. over all it’s been a quite relaxing stay here,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Great app!,Looking for place to camp? Look no further! This app has everything you need. My go to website and App.,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Peaceful and green,"If you enjoy green grass, shade trees, clean grounds, and peace & quiet then look here.  If you need full speed WiFi & the latest big city perfection, and don’t bring all that with you, then maybe not.  Hard packed gravel & dirt.  Bathrooms are clean and roomy.  Laundry room is the same, uses quarters.  Site management very responsive.  We had no trouble driving and parking our 35’ motor home.  Did I say this place is clean, quiet, peaceful and green?",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Awesome App! 1 request though,You should make a offline version. Camp sites and addresses for when the Grid goes down.,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Must provide email after three searches,Should be disclosed before install back to their site with no registration required,2
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Nice,So far great app to find camps and rest areas!,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Great app...,It would be great if it gave a little more information such as elevation and weather.  But very easy to use and helpful planning family camping trips,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Not worth the money,"I bought this app based on two reviews on YouTube.  They bragged about how useful this app was for finding free camping locations.
I have not found this app to be worth the money, it does not have as complete a set of free and pay sites, as other camping apps I am using.
I would not recommend buying this app.
In addition, after some use, the app REQUIRES you to sign up to continue to use the app.  I didn’t plan on this.",1
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,BEST CAMPING APP!!,I absolutely love this app! Soooo helpful! Thank app creators! Lol,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Great place,30 amp 50 amp. Water sewer. Free. It doesn’t get any better than this. We will stay here on the way back. We just would have been happy with a parking spot. But Walsh! An oasis on free.,4
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,So helpful!!,We are on a 2 week road trip and this app has been so helpful! We are finding great campgrounds along the way.,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.5,Helpful/Good Site,"This site is a good source of information for campers. I would recommend it highly. We used this for our first vacationing in new areas we have not been too. 
The information about the campground is limited but with us campers putting in reviews, pictures and information helps others.
I am very glad we found this.:)",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.4,Best Camping App,Campendium is an excellent amp for finding the right place to camp. The App is very user friendly and so well laid out. We love that they include cell phone coverage in their site info pages!,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.4,Great app,Searching for a place.  We are newbies and this has been invaluable.  Hope to see a big rig friendly search capability soon.,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.4,A Great Experience,"We recently stayed at the RV Park after the National Park Campgrounds filled up. We can honestly say that it was a great experience staying at San-Suz-Ed. The new owners Jason & Katie (& family) made us fill right at home, and they are making improvements to the campground daily. We were sad to leave after 4 days, and would have loved to stay longer. The RV Park was full, but it never felt crowded and was always peaceful and quiet at night. We had fun sitting around the community campfire in the evenigs and sharing stories while our daughter made new friends. We definitely recommend this campground to anyone looking, and we will be back next year for sure. Some sites are back in, and others are pull through. We stayed in two sites, 17 & 24. Both sites were easy to get in and didn’t require much to level the trailer, a few block under the tires to help, this is the Mountains after all.",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.4,Indispensable,"No matter where we are, we’ve found campgrounds that suit our preferences. I love that dispersed camping and boondocking sites are included.",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.4,Great Experience!!!,We try to always stay here. Facilities are always clean staff are really nice!!  They have a full schedule for the kids each day if they want to participate. Sites are nice. (WiFi is only close to the office- or the last time we were there),5

campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.4,Wonderful app,Who ever developed this app it’s great!! I travel a lot and I’m easily able to find the best rate closest well maintained camp sites around me. Easy to use accurate fast. I consider this app part of my camping gear!,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.3,Useless,App could not find my location.  Just error messages,1
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.3,Ok App,"I was very excited to use this app. However, it keeps crashing and I have to start my search all over. Not sure I’ll keep it.",3
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.3,"Can’t create an account, can’t see parks",You can’t look around without creating an account. I couldn’t remember my password so I reset it but it kept saying I had to verify my account but it wouldn’t say how or where. Going to RV PARKY. Easier to use.,2
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.3,Great app but problem reviewing,"The app is invaluable in finding campsites both off the beaten path in BLM or forest service land as well as in national parks with larger campgrounds. Great filters and information from reviewers.

However, I’ve tried several times to review multiple campsites within the app and it is not saving those reviews - I’m not sure if it’s a bug or just me doing something wrong, but it would be nice if I could contribute with reviews on the campgrounds I’ve visited.",4
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.2,Forced to sign up,Shouldn't be forced to sign up at all. Didn't get into one search before the pop-up demanded I sign up! Personally I'd rather have the option after using it...,1
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.0,The quickest & easiest way to find a place to live!,"I love this app! 

The website has always been great but I’m totally excited that there’s an app now. I’m on my phone all the time, so this has been a real game changer. 

I honestly can’t believe how many FREE campsites there are to choose from. I’ve been able to find at least one in every state we’ve been to (30 so far!).

10/10 definitely recommend!!",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.1.0,Best campsite reviews anywhere!,"Campendium is my “go to” app for finding great places to camp.  Not only is the database among the most complete,  but the users put a lot of time and effort into writing their reviews which are among the most detailed available anywhere. Don’t leave home without this app!",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.0.3,Quality app!,"I love this app! Well maintained and the peer reviews are great. 

Only two items I’d change would be an easier option for signing in and a way to “Star” or “favorite” where I have been and where I’d like to go. Much like a wishlist.",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.0.3,No ability to bookmark?!,Why can’t I create “lists” and “bookmarks”? It’s a pretty massive failure for this app to allow me to research campgrounds and then I have to copy and paste the info into a different app. Seriously?! I’ll use other apps if that’s the case.,2
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.0.3,By far the best! Simplemente la mejor.,"Seriously guys, if you are into Rving, camping and road trips this app right here is a must have.

Si les gusta acampar con casas móviles o simplemente viajar por carretera está es la aplicación que necesitan.",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.0.2,Our Go To app for finding camps,"Campendium is our number one tool to find our next camping destination. There’s a great wealth of information and photos on so many campsites, RV park and campgrounds. The app makes it easy to search by location. Once you have found that perfect spot, click on maps for immediate directions. You can also go right to the campsites website or reservations link. 

Great app and a great solution.",5

We have camped for free in some of the most beautiful places! We have camped directly on the rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona, with the view of Twin lakes in Colorado, on the Vermillion Cliffs in Utah and many other wonderful places. Most places will have a fire ring as well! So thankful it has become an app! The app works so well and we are excited to continue to use it! @mcgee.ventures",5

Just open the app find what kind of spot suits your needs, and you'll know exactly what to expect when you get there.",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.0,"Simple, indispensable","As a full-time traveler, the Campendium website has been an indispensable tool in my arsenal since its inception.

campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.0,Best camping destination review and finder app,"I always refer to Campendium first when picking camping destinations...now things have become even easier with the app. The user interface is intuitive and the campground reviews (including cell coverage) from REAL people who have stayed there is super useful. Reviews also include photos from reviewers, not campground owners, so I feel like I'm getting a better idea of what the campground actually looks like before I decide to stay there. It also makes it easy to find boondocking options. 
I love this app!",5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.0,The best app for camping! 🏕,"My husband and I have used Campendium for the past 2 years to find the best campsites in America, Canada and Mexico.

campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.0,My Favorite camping app,Campendium is my go to when finding places to stay in our RV.  I am glad all the things I love about the website were put into this app. The app makes it so much easier when we are traveling to find an RV park with reviews and places to boondock when we want to get away from it all.  This is a must have for people traveling in an RV!,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.0,Quick Check,Put in a few dozen searches and used the map markers to bring the selection to top of list. Nice feature. Seems accurate as I used a few spots we have camped that are off the grid ... got usable results. A nice tool to have in the trVels,5
campendium-rv-tent-camping,1.0,Amazing filters,"Just like their website, which we have been using for years... this app has amazing filters to help you find the kind of site you want!  We rarely make plans and this helps us find amazing places as we travel (full-time for nearly 3yrs).
